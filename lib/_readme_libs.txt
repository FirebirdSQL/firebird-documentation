As from Friday, 13 Jan 2006, new or upgraded libraries will no longer
be committed to CVS. It's a waste of server space and they're all Open
Source anyway, the sources being archived by their respective projects.

The necessary libs can now be downloaded from
  http://www.firebirdsql.org/devel/doc/libs/
where they will be kept up-to-date.

At this moment, you need to pick up these files from there:
  fbdocs-lib-ant.zip
  fbdocs-lib-saxon.zip
  foxon.jar

Place them right here in the manual/lib directory. Unpack any ZIPs.
Overwrite existing files if necessary.


The 6 other libs (fop, jimi, etc.) will be phased out of CVS later.


NOTE: If you still find the file "optional.jar" in the lib folder,
      delete it!
