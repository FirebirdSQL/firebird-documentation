  <title>Installing the Driver</title>
  <para>The kit that you install will depend on what you plan to use it for.  Regardless 
  of whether you intend to connect to a 64-bit or a 32-bit Firebird server, you must 
  install the driver and the Firebird client (<filename>fbclient.dll</filename> on 
  Windows, <filename>libfbclient.so</filename> on Linux) that matches the 
  <quote>bitness</quote> of your client application.</para>
  <para>Installation is similar for both options. You can install both the 32-bit and the
  64-bit driver on the same machine if the user is going to access Firebird from
  multiple applications of mixed bitness.  Care will be be needed to ensure that 
  each application will connect using the correct DSN for the required driver.</para>
  <note>
    <title>Note for the Less Technically Versed</title>
    <para>...because we have been asked:  if you want to connect your Windows 
    application&#x2014;Excel or LibreCalc, for example&#x2014;to your database running
    on a Linux or other POSIX server, you want the Windows driver, not the POSIX one.
    See also the note below about the Firebird client library.</para>

    <title>Downloading the Driver</title>
    <para>The Downloads section at 
    <ulink url="https://www.firebirdsql.org/en/odbc-driver/">https://www.firebirdsql.org/en/odbc-driver/</ulink>
    clearly identifies the bitness of the various kits available, with the latest release at 
    the top of the page.  For example, the 32-bit installer kit for Windows, at the time
    this document was prepared, was named <filename>Firebird_ODBC_2.0.5.156_Win32.exe</filename>,
    indicating that is was the executable installer for the 32-bit version.  The following
    table should help to indicate what you will need.  The <quote>N.n.n.xxx</quote> infix used
    here indicates <quote>Major1.Major2.Minor.Subrelease</quote>.  The <quote>Subrelease</quote> part
    changes the most frequently.</para>

    installing the 64-bit one.  Under the hood, the 32-bit driver library will be installed
    into <filename>\windows\sysWOW64</filename> on a 64-bit Windows.  Any other install will
    place the driver in <filename>windows\system32</filename>.</para>
