[[rnfb30-apiods-ods]]
== ODS (On-Disk Structure) Changes

[[rnfb30-apiods-ods-number]]
=== New ODS Number

Firebird 3.0 creates databases with an ODS (On-Disk Structure) version of 12.
In the initial release, a database with an older ODS cannot be opened by Firebird 3.0.
In order to work with a database with an older ODS it will be necessary to make a backup using _gbak_ under the older server and restore it with _gbak_ on Firebird 3.

[NOTE]
====
A legacy provider for databases with ODS 8 to 11.2 is planned for a future sub-release.
====

[[rnfb30-apiods-ods-12-2]]
==== Firebird 3.0.4: ODS 12.2 for POSIX Platforms

In the version 3.0.4 sub-release we have a minor ODS change for databases created or restored on a Linux x86 (32-bit) platform and all other POSIX platforms including MacOSX.
The new ODS for these databases is 12.2.

The change is due to a change in the page layout of the system table `RDB$GENERATORS` affecting only some platforms.
ODS 12.0 databases copied across platforms, e.g., from Linux-x86 to Linux-x64, show wrong values for generators, typically very large.

[[rnfb30-apiods-ods-12-other]]
===== Other Platforms

The most popular platforms -- Windows and Linux x64 (64-bit) -- were not affected by the change.
They were carefully checked to verify that, for them, there is no actual difference between ODS 12.0 and 12.2.
To avoid disturbing users of these platforms with a new ODS, it was decided to retain the ODS number 12.0 for them.

For non-Windows and non-Intel-Linux platforms, developers could not perform all the required checks.
The only guaranteed safe solution for them was the minor ODS upgrade.

To restate, MacOSX (32-bit and 64-bit) and 32-bit Linux builds will create (and restore) databases as ODS 12.2.

Existing databases (with ODS 12.0) are always opened successfully with Firebird 3.0.4 on the platform where they were  initially created.
Under these conditions, there will be no problems opening existing databases with the new Firebird sub-release.

[[rnfb30-apiods-ods-12-copying]]
===== Cross-Platform File-Copying

Cross-platform copying of any ODS 12.0 database other than those created on Windows and Linux-x64 is best avoided: Firebird versions < 3.0.3 may produce errors with generators, while version 3.0.4 will report an issue and not attach to such a database.

Our checks did not reveal any cross-platform compatibility issues between ODS 12.2 databases and ODS 12.0 databases from Windows and Linux-x64 with matching Endianness.

[[rnfb30-apiods-ods-impids]]
=== Implementation ID is Deprecated
Alex Peshkov

The Implementation ID in the ODS of a database is deprecated in favour of a new field in database headers describing hardware details that need to match in order for the database to be assumed to have been created by a compatible implementation.

The old Implementation ID is replaced with a 4-byte structure consisting of hardware ID, operating system ID, compiler ID and compatibility flags.
The three ID fields are just for information: the ODS does not depend upon them directly, and they are not checked when opening the database.

The compatibility flags _are checked_ for a match between the database and the engine opening it.
Currently, we have only one flag, for endianness.
As previously, Firebird will not open a database on little-endian that was created on big-endian, nor vice versa.

.Sample gstat Output
[source]
----
# ./gstat -h employee
Database /usr/home/firebird/trunk/gen/Debug/firebird/examples/empbuild/employee.fdb
Database header page information:
        ..............
        Implementation          HW=AMD/Intel/x64 little-endian OS=Linux CC=gcc
        ..............
----

The purpose is to make it easier to do ports of Firebird for new platforms.

[[rnfb30-apiods-dbsize]]
=== Maximum Database Size

Maximum database size is increased to 2^32^ pages (previously 2^31^ -1 pages).
The new limit is 16TB/32TB/64TB, depending on the page size.

[[rnfb30-apiods-page-size]]
=== Maximum Page Size

The maximum page size remains 16 KB (16384 bytes).

[[rnfb30-apiods-num-buffers]]
=== Maximum Number of Page Buffers in Cache

The maximum number of pages that can be configured for the database cache depends on whether the database is running under 64-bit or 32-bit Firebird:

* 64-bit : 2^31^ -1 (2,147,483,647) pages
* 32-bit : 128,000 pages, i.e. unchanged from version 2.5

[[rnfb30-apiods-transaclimit]]
=== Extension of Transaction ID Space Limit
Dmitry Yemanov

Historically, the transaction ID space was limited to 2^31^ -1 transactions, counted from the time the database was created.
After that point, the database becomes unavailable until backup and restore is performed to reset the transaction ID counter back to zero.
In Firebird 3.0, the transaction ID space has been raised to 2^48^ bits, or roughly equal to 2.8 * 10^14^ transactions, increasing the database up-time without backup and restore by a factor 2^17^.

With the introduction of 48-bit internal transaction IDs that are publicly (via the API and the `MON$` tables) represented as 64-bit numbers.
In later versions, the transaction space could be extended up to 2^63^ -1.

The implemented solution has no additional storage overhead until the transaction counters grow beyond the 2^32^ boundary.

[[rnfb30-apiods-otherlimits]]
=== Limits Raised for Attachment and Statement IDs

Attachment IDs and statement IDs were changed to 64-bit numbers, both internally and externally via the API and the `MON$` tables.

==== Changes to System Tables

From Firebird 3 forward, all non-virtual system tables (`RDB$*`) are read-only.

[NOTE]
====
In version 3.0.4, the read-only restriction was relaxed to permit `CREATE`, `ALTER` and `DROP` operations on the indexes of system tables.

[[rnfb3-apiods-montables]]
===== Monitoring Tables
Dmitry Yemanov

[[rnfb3-apiods-montables-reporting]]
====== Changes to Client Address Reporting

Prior to Firebird 3.0, the network address of remote clients were reported in `MON$ATTACHMENTS.MON$REMOTE_ADDRESS` and `RDB$GET_CONTEXT('SYSTEM', 'CLIENT_ADDRESS')`.
For TCP/IP protocol (a.k.a. INET), it contained a TCPv4 dot-separated address.
For Named Pipes (a.k.a. WNET, NetBeui) protocol, it was always `NULL`.
For shared memory (aka XNET) protocol, it contained the local host name.

Starting with Firebird 3.0, the network address of a remote client contains the TCP/IP port number of the remote client, separated with a slash: 

[source]]
----
<IP address>/<port>
----

The port number is also retrieved via the new built-in context variable `RDB$GET_CONTEXT('SYSTEM', 'CLIENT_PORT')`. 

The host name is also reported now, in the new column `MON$REMOTE_HOST`.

.Alert
[WARNING]
====
The WNET (Named Pipes/Netbeui) protocol should be considered as deprecated.
It is likely to be abandoned in a future version.

[[rnfb30-apiods-api]]
== Application Programming Interfaces

A new public API replaces the legacy one in new applications, especially object-oriented ones.
The interface part can be found in the header file `Interfaces.h` in the directory `/include/firebird` beneath the installation root directory.

[NOTE]
====
POSIX installations have a symlink pointing to `/usr/include/firebird/Interfaces.h`
====

The new public API can be also used inside user-defined routines (UDR, q.v.) for callbacks inside the engine, allowing a UDR to select or modify something in the database, for example.

The main difference between the new API and the legacy one is that UDRs can query and modify data in the same connection or transaction context as the user query that called that UDR.
It is now possible to write external triggers and procedures, not just external functions (UDFs).

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-oo]]
=== Interfaces and the New Object-oriented API
Alex Peshkov

Firebird needed a modernised API for a number of compelling reasons.

* High on the list was the limitation of the 16-bit integer pervading the legacy API, encompassing message size, SQL operator length, BLOB data portions, to name a few examples.
While 16-bit was probably adequate when that old API came to life, in today's environments it is costly to work around.
+ 
A trivial solution might be to add new functions that support 32-bit variables.
The big downside is the obvious need to retain support for the old API by having pairs of functions with the same functionality but differing integer sizes.
In fact, we did something like this to support 64-bit performance counters, for no better reason than being pressed to provide for it without having a more elegant way to implement it.
* Another important reason, less obvious, derives from the era when Firebird's predecessor, InterBase, did not support SQL.
It used a non-standard query language, GDML, to manage databases.
Data requests were transported between client and server using messages whose formats were defined at request compilation time in BLR (binary language representation).
In SQL, the operator does not contain the description of the message format, so the decision was taken to surround each message with a short BLR sequence describing its format.
+ 
The ISC API also has the XSQLDA layer over BLR.
The trap with the XSQLDA solution is that it encapsulates both the location of the data and their format, making it possible to change location or format (or both) between fetch calls.
Hence, the need for the BLR wrapping in _every_ fetch call -- notwithstanding, this potential capability to change the data format between fetches was broken in the network layer before Firebird existed.
+ 
To support the XSQLDA layer that rides on top of the message-based API, that lower level API also has support sending format BLR at every turn.
+ 
This system involving calls processing data through multiple layers is hard to extend and wastes performance;
the SQLDA is not simple to use;
the desire to fix it was strong.
* Other reasons -- numerous but perhaps less demanding -- for changing the API included enhancing the status vector and optimizing dynamic library loading.
Interfaces also make it so much easier and more comfortable to use the messages API.

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-oo-noncom]]
==== The Non-COM Choice

The new interfaces are not compatible with COM, deliberately, and the reasons have to do with future performance enhancement.

At the centre of the Providers architecture in Firebird 3.0 is the _y-valve_, which is directed at dispatching API calls to the correct provider.
Amongst the potential providers are older ones with potentially older interfaces.
If we used COM, we would have to call the method `IUnknown` for each call (including record fetch), just to ensure that the provider really had some newer API method.
Along with that comes the likelihood of future additions to the catalogue of API calls to optimize performance.
A COM-based solution does not play well with that.

Firebird interfaces, unlike COM, support multiple versions.
The interface version is determined by the total number of virtual functions it encompasses and is stored as a pointer-size integer at the beginning of the virtual functions table.
This makes it possible for very fast checking of the interface version, since it requires no virtual call.
That is to say, the pointer check has no overhead, unlike COM.

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-oo-hierarchy]]
==== The Hierarchy of Interfaces

A detailed discussion of all the functions presented by all the interfaces is outside the scope of this overview.
The general schematic looks like this:

// credit for image: Alex Peshkov
image::rlsnotes/rlsnotes30/interfaces_hierarchy.png[align="center",pdfwidth="100%",scaledwidth=496px]

The base of the structure is `IVersioned`.
It is the interface that enables a version upgrade.
A lot of interfaces not requiring additional lifetime control are based directly on `IVersioned`.
`IMaster` is one example already mentioned.
Others include a number of callback interfaces whose lifetimes must match the lifetimes of the objects from which they were to be used for callback.

Two interfaces deal with lifetime control: `IDisposable` and `IRefCounted`.
The latter is especially active in the creation of other interfaces: `IPlugin` is reference counted, as are many other interfaces that are used by plug-ins.
These include the interfaces that describe database attachment, transaction management and SQL statements.

Not everything needs the extra overhead of a reference-counted interface.
For example, `IMaster`, the main interface that calls functions available to the rest of the API, has unlimited lifetime by definition.
For others, the API is defined strictly by the lifetime of a parent interface;
the `IStatus` interface is non-threaded.
For interfaces with limited lifetimes, it is of benefit to have a simple way to destroy them, that is, a `dispose()` function.

Each plug-in has one and only one main interface -- `IPlugin` -- which is responsible for basic plug-in functionality.
In fact, a lot of plugins have only this interface, although that is not a requirement.

Finally, there is `IProvider`, a kind of "`main`" plug-in in the Firebird API.
`IProvider` is derived from `IPlugin` and must be implemented by every provider.
If you want to write your own provider you must implement `IProvider`.
It is implemented also by the _y-valve_: it is the _y-valve_ implementation that is returned to the user when the `getDispatcher()` function from the master interface is called.

`IProvider` contains functions enabling creation of an attachment to a database (attach and create) or to the Services Manager.

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-oo-qanda]]
==== Interfaces Q & A

[qanda]
We access new API using `IMaster`, but how to get access to `IMaster` itself?::

This is done using just the one new API function `fb_get_master_interface()`.
It is exported by the `fbclient` library.
Also, `IMaster` is passed as a parameter to each plug-in during its registration in the system.

The non-use of COM-based interfaces was said to be to avoid working with `IUnknown` methods and that this is done due to performance issues, instead you have to check the interface version. Why is that faster than using `IUnknown`?::

As was already mentioned, we do not need to execute virtual calls when checking the interface version.
Taking into an account that each virtual call means a reset of the CPU cache, it is an important difference, especially for the very small calls like getting specific metadata properties from `IMetadata`.

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-other]]
=== Other New APIs

Other new APIs support various plug-ins by declaring the interfaces between the engine and the plug-in.
Besides pluggable authentication and pluggable encryption, Firebird 3 supports "`external engines`", bridges between the engine and the execution environments that can run UDRs: native code, Java and others.
By and large they are intended for use by third-party solution providers, rather than for client application development.

For creating custom plug-ins and bridges, the relevant interface (API) needs to be implemented in the plug-in code.

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-improve]]
=== API Improvements

The following improvements to the API should be noted.

[[rnfb30-apiods-sqlsize]]
==== Some SQL Size Limits Removed Using New API
Dmitry Yemanov

If and only if the new API is being used:

* The size of the body of a stored procedure or a trigger can exceed the traditional limit of 32 KB.
The theoretical limit provided by the new API is 4GB.
At the moment -- as a security measure -- a hard-coded limit of 10MB is imposed.
The same limit of 10MB also applies to any user-defined DSQL query.
* The total size of all input or output parameters for a stored procedure or a user-defined DSQL query is no longer limited to the traditional size of (64KB minus overhead).
The theoretical limit provided by the new API is 4GB.

[[rnfb30-apiods-legacy-api]]
==== Legacy API

Improvements to the legacy API include:

[[rnfb30-dsql-scrollcursors]]
===== Scrollable Cursor Support
Dmitry Yemanov

In PSQL, a <<rnfb30-psql-scrollcursors,scrollable cursor>> can be operated on directly to navigate flexibly from the current row to any another row either forwards or backwards.
API support is available to make scrollable cursors available to DSQL applications.

[[rnfb30-dsql-cursoruse]]
====== Scrollable Cursor Usage

The result set must be opened with the flag `IStatement::CURSOR_TYPE_SCROLLABLE` explicitly specified.

[float]
====== Fetch Methods

The following fetch methods of the IResultSet interface are available:

[source]
----
int fetchNext(IStatus* status, void* message);
// equivalent to FETCH NEXT FROM <cursor name>
----

Moves the cursor's current position to the next row and returns it.
If the cursor is empty or already positioned at the last row, the condition `NO_DATA` is returned.

[source]
----
int fetchPrior(IStatus* status, void* message);
// equivalent to FETCH PRIOR FROM <cursor name>
----

Moves the cursor's current position to the prior row and returns it.
If the cursor is empty or already positioned at the first row, the condition `NO_DATA` is returned.

[source]
----
int fetchFirst(IStatus* status, void* message);
// equivalent to FETCH FIRST FROM <cursor name>
----

Moves the cursor's current position to the first row and returns it.
If the cursor is empty, the condition `NO_DATA` is returned.

[source]
----
int fetchLast(IStatus* status, void* message);
// equivalent to FETCH LAST FROM <cursor name>
----

Moves the cursor's current position to the last row and returns it.
If the cursor is empty, the condition `NO_DATA` is returned.

[source]
----
int fetchAbsolute(IStatus* status, int position, void* message);
// equivalent to FETCH ABSOLUTE <position> FROM <cursor name>
----

Moves the cursor's current position to the specified _position_ and returns the located row.
If _position_ is beyond the cursor's boundaries, the condition `NO_DATA` is returned.

[source]
----
int fetchRelative(IStatus* status, int offset, void* message);
// equivalent to FETCH RELATIVE <offset> FROM <cursor name>
----

Moves the cursor's current position backward or forward by the specified _offset_ and returns the located row.
If the calculated position is beyond the cursor's boundaries, the condition `NO_DATA` is returned.

[NOTE]
====
. When a scrolling option is omitted, `NO SCROLL` is implied (i.e. the cursor is opened as forward-only).
This means that only the `fetchNext()` API call can be used.
Other fetch methods will return an error.
. Scrollable cursors are internally materialized as a temporary record set, thus consuming memory/disk resources, so this feature should be used only when really necessary.
====

[[rnfb30-api-spb-gbakstats]]
===== SPB Support for New Statistics Feature in _gbak_ Output
Vlad Khorsun

A new, much requested feature was added to _gbak_ verbose output: optional run-time statistics.
 <<rnfb30-util-gbakstats,Read about it here>>.
The feature is fully supported in the Services API with a new item in the SPB (Services Parameter Block), 

[source]
----
#define isc_spb_bkp_stat 15
----

along with its synonym

[source]
----
#define isc_spb_res_stat isc_spb_bkp_stat
----

[float]
===== Usage

[listing]
----
isc_spb_bkp_stat, <len>, <string>
isc_spb_res_stat, <len>, <string>
----

where `<len>` (2 bytes) indicates the length of the following string parameter, and `<string>` (1-4 bytes) is a string consisting of one character per statistics item.

The _fbsvcmgr_ utility also supports the new SPB tags.

[[rnfb30-api-overflow-error]]
===== Better Error Reports for String Overflows
Alex Peshkov

Include expected and actual string length in the error message for string overflows (SQLCODE -802).

[[rnfb30-api-pagetype-error]]
===== More Detail in "`Wrong Page Type`" Error Reports
Alex Peshkov

More details in the error message "wrong page type", i.e. identifying expected and encountered page types by name instead of numerical type.

[[rnfb30-api-info-freepag]]
===== New Item for isc_database_info() Call
Vlad Khorsun

An option was added to the API function `isc_database_info()` to return the number of free pages in a database.
See http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/CORE-1538[CORE-1538].

[[rnfb30-api-dpb-moreinfo]]
===== Compression and Encryption Status Info
Alex Peshkov

Added in Firebird 3.0.3, see http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/CORE-5601[CORE-5601].

Compression details and encryption status of a connection (`fb_info_conn_flags`) have been added to the `getInfo()` API call.
The data stored in the information block are of type integer in network format, accessible as `isc_vax_integer`.

Currently only 2 bits are meaningful: 

[source]
----
#define isc_dpb_addr_flag_conn_compressed   0x01
#define isc_dpb_addr_flag_conn_encrypted    0x02
----

[[rnfb30-api-spb-override-linger]]
===== New Services Tag for Overriding LINGER
Alex Peshkov

The Services API now includes the tag `isc_spb_prp_nolinger`, for example (in one line):

[source]
----
fbsvcmgr host:service_mgr user sysdba password xxx
       action_properties dbname employee prp_nolinger
----

For information regarding LINGER, see <<rnfb30-ddl-enhance-linger,the write-up in the DDL chapter>>.

[[rnfb30-api-spb-icu]]
===== New Services and DPB Tags for ICU Version Changes

The Services API now includes the tag `isc_spb_rpr_icu` to update ICU-dependent collations and rebuild dependent indices.

[source]
----
fbsvcmgr host:service_mgr user sysdba password xxx
       action_repair dbname employee rpr_icu
----

The same functionality is available to administrators by specifying database parameter buffer item `isc_dpb_reset_icu` on connect to the database.

This functionality is also available through _gfix_, see <<#rnfb30-util-gfix-icu,gfix -icu switch>>.

[[rnfb30-api-dpb-moreinfo-pluginlist]]
===== Enable Use of {asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}_auth_plugin_list Item from Application

*Firebird 3.0.4*: To specify the names of authentication plug-ins, an application must create a config string with "```AuthClient = <plugin-list>```", along with lines for other options.
A specific DPB/SPB item actually exists, item `isc_dpb_auth_plugin_list`/`isc_spb_auth_plugin_list` that the client itself uses to communicate the plug-in list to the server.
However, if an application populated that same item, it was ignored by the client.

This improvement allows an application to use the item `item isc_dpb_auth_plugin_list`/`isc_spb_auth_plugin_list` in lieu of creating and passing a config string for it.

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-winlocal]]
==== New Connection Formats for Local Superserver Clients on Windows

In previous Firebird versions, a serverless protocol known as "`Windows Local`" was available to local clients connecting to Superserver on a Windows platform, using the XNET subsystem.
A typical connection string looked like this: 

[source]
----
c:\Program Files\Firebird_2_5\examples\empbuild\employee.fdb
----

Under the new unified server, that form of connection attempts to load an embedded server.
It is no longer valid for a serverless client connection to Superserver.
If you try, you will get a refusal message to the effect "`File is in use by another process`".
This is not a bug.
Since Superserver clients share resources, another server (in this case, an embedded server) cannot attach a client to the same database that Superserver has any clients attached to.

However, all is not lost.
The XNET subsystem can still do local client sessions for Superserver.
You just need a more elaborate connection string now.
You have a few choices: 

* this one is the former "`Windows local`", using the XNET subsystem and shared memory for a (nominally) serverless connection:
+
[listing]
----
xnet://alias-or-path-to-database
----
+
So, for our connection to the employee database:
+
[source]
----
xnet://c:\Program Files\Firebird_3_0\examples\empbuild\employee.fdb
----
+
or using an alias:
+
[source]
----
xnet://employee
----
* Connection to host/port via TCP:
+
[listing]
----
inet://host:port/alias-or-path-to-database
----
* Connection to host/port via TCP, restricting the name search to IPv4:
+
[listing]
----
inet4://host:port/alias-or-path-to-database
----
+
This option was added in version 3.0.1.
See also the configuration parameter <<rnfb30-fbconf-ipv6only,IPv6V6Only>>.

* Connection to host/port via Named Pipes (aka NetBEUI):

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-onlinevalidation]]
==== Perform Some Validation Services On-line
Vlad Khorsun

This feature was ported forward from Firebird 2.5.4.

Database validation enables low-level checks of the consistency of on-disk structures and even to fix some minor corruptions.
The recommended procedure for any valuable database is for the DBA to validate a database periodically to ensure it is healthy.

Exclusive access to the database is required: any kind of concurrent access is forbidden during validation.
Sometimes, blocking user access could be a major hold-up, especially if the database is large and complex.

Online validation is a new feature that allows some consistency checks to be performed without exclusive access.

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-onlinevalidation-what]]
===== What Online Validation Can Do

* validate some (or all) user tables in a database.
+ 
_System tables are not validated._
* validate some (or all) indices

Other ODS checks, such as Header/PIP/TIP/Generators pages, are not performed.

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-onlinevalidation-protect]]
===== Protection During Online Validation

While a table (and/or its index) is undergoing validation, user attachments are allowed to read this table.
Any attempt to change data (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`) will wait until validation finishes or, depending on the lock timeout of the user transaction, will return a lock timeout error.

Any kind of garbage collection on the table or its indexes is disabled whilst it is undergoing validation:

* background and cooperative garbage collection will just skip this table
* sweep will be terminated with an error

When online validation starts to check a table, it acquires a couple of locks to prevent concurrent modifications of its data:

* a relation lock in PR (protected read) mode
* (NEW) a garbage collection lock in PW (protected write) mode

Both locks are acquired using a user-specified lock timeout.
An error is reported for any lock request that fails and that table is skipped.

Once the locks are acquired, the table and its indexes are validated in the same way as a full validation does it.
The locks are released when it completes and the whole procedure is repeated for the next table.

===== The New Services API action: isc_action_svc_validate

Online validation is implemented as a Firebird service and is accessed through the Services API.
Thus, it cannot be run from the _gfix_ utility.

The call involves the following elements:

[listing]
----
Action:
  isc_action_svc_validate

Parameters:
  isc_spb_dbname :
    database file name, string, mandatory

  isc_spb_val_tab_incl, isc_spb_val_tab_excl,
  isc_spb_val_idx_incl, isc_spb_val_idx_excl :
    patterns for tables\indices names, string, optional

  isc_spb_val_lock_timeout :
    lock timeout, integer, optional

Output:
  text messages with progress of online validation process

[[rnfb30-apiods-api-onlinevalidation-svc-interact]]
===== Using isc_action_svc_validate Interactively

The _fbsvcmgr_ utility has full support for the new service.
The syntax is:

[source]
----
fbsvcmgr [host:]service_mgr [user <...>] [password <...>]
  action_validate dbname <filename>
  [val_tab_incl <pattern>]
  [val_tab_excl <pattern>]
  [val_idx_incl <pattern>]
  [val_idx_excl <pattern>]
  [val_lock_timeout <number>]
----

where 

[horizontal]
`val_tab_incl`::
pattern for table names to include in validation run

`val_tab_excl`::
pattern for table names to exclude from validation run

`val_idx_incl`::
pattern for index names to include in validation run, by default '```%```', i.e. all indexes

`val_idx_excl`::
pattern for index names to exclude from validation run

`val_lock_timeout`::
lock timeout, used to acquire locks for table to validate, in seconds, default is 10 secs.
'```0```' is no-wait, '```-1```' is infinite wait

.Usage Notes
[NOTE]
====
* Patterns are regular expressions, processed by the same rules as `SIMILAR TO` expressions.
* All patterns are case-sensitive, regardless of database dialect.
* If the pattern for tables is omitted then all user tables will be validated.
* If the pattern for indexes is omitted then all indexes of the appointed tables will be validated.
* System tables are not validated.
* To specify a list of tables or indexes:
[loweralpha]
.. Separate names with the pipe character '```|```'
.. Do not add spaces: "```TAB1 | TAB2```" is wrong, use "```TAB1|TAB2```"
.. Enclose the whole list in double quotes to avoid confusing the command interpreter
====

.Examples
. Validate all tables in database `c:\db.fdb` with names starting with `A`.
Indexes are not validated.
Lock wait is not performed.

fbsvcmgr.exe service_mgr user SYSDBA password masterkey
  action_validate dbname c:\db.fdb
  val_tab_incl A%
  val_idx_excl %
  val_lock_timeout 0
----
. Validate tables `TAB1` and `TAB2` and all their indexes.
Lock wait timeout is 10 seconds (the default):
