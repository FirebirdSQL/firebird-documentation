Security enhancements in Firebird 5 include:

== System privilege PROFILE_ANY_ATTACHMENT

New system privilege `PROFILE_ANY_ATTACHMENT` has been added to the engine.

When remote SQL profiling is used and the attachment being profiled is from a different user, the calling user must have this system privilege.

See more details in the <<rnfb50-engine-profiler>> chapter.
