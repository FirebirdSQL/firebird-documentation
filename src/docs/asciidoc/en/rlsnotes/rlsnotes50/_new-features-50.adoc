- `SKIP LOCKED` clause for `SELECT WITH LOCK`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements;
- Inline minor ODS upgrade;
- Compiled statement cache;
- PSQL and SQL profiler;

- Network support for scrollable cursors;

The following list summarises the features and changes, with links to the chapters and topics where more detailed information can be found.

[[rnfb50-new-complete]]
=== Complete In Firebird 5.0 Beta 1

Parallel (multi-threaded) operations::
Such operations as logical backup/restore, sweeping and `CREATE INDEX` statement execution can be executed in parallel by multiple threads, thus decreasing the total operation time.

Tracker references: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/1783[#1783], https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/3374[#3374], https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7447[#7447]
+
See chapters <<rnfb50-engine-parallel>> and <<rnfb50-utils-parallel>> for details.

Support for partial indices::
The `CREATE INDEX` DDL statement has been extended to support <<rnfb50-ddl-partial-indices, partial indices>>, i.e. an index may now declare a condition that defines the subset of records to be indexed.
+
Tracker reference: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/pull/7257[#7257]

`SKIP LOCKED` clause::
New clause <<rnfb50-dml-skip-locked, `SKIP LOCKED`>> was introduced for statements `SELECT WITH LOCK`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE`.
It allows to skip the already locked records while reading the table.
+
Tracker reference: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/pull/7350[#7350]

Inline minor ODS upgrade::
An ability to <<rnfb50-engine-inline-upgrade, upgrade the database>> to the latest minor ODS version has been introduced, it does not require a backup/restore cycle.
+
Tracker reference: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/pull/7397[#7397]

Compiled statement cache::
Per-attachment <<rnfb50-engine-stmt-cache, cache of compiled SQL statements>> has been implemented.
+
Tracker reference: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/pull/7144[#7144]

PSQL and SQL profiler::
A built-in ability to <<rnfb50-engine-profiler, profile SQL and PSQL statements>> has been added, thus making possible to measure execution time at different levels.
+
Tracker reference: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/pull/7086[#7086]

Support for `WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE` in the `MERGE` statement::
The `MERGE` statement has been extended to support the <<rnfb50-dml-matched-by-source, `WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE` clause>>.
+
Tracker reference: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/6681[#6681]

Built-in functions `UNICODE_CHAR` and `UNICODE_VAL`::
New <<rnfb50-dml-unicode-funcs, built-in functions `UNICODE_CHAR` and `UNICODE_VAL`>> have been added to allow conversion between Unicode code point and character.
+
Tracker reference: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/6798[#6798]

`RDB$BLOB_UTIL` new system package::
New <<rnfb50-engine-blob-util, system package `RDB$BLOB_UTIL`>> has been added to allow various operations with BLOBs in the PSQL modules.
+
Tracker reference: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/pull/281[#281]

Optimize the record-level RLE algorithm for a denser compression of shorter-than-declared strings and sets of subsequent NULLs::
The built-in <<rnfb50-engine-rle, compression algorithm has been improved>> to allow denser compression of records.
+
Tracker reference: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/4723[#4723]

More cursor-related details in the plan output::
Execution plan now contains <<rnfb50-engine-cursor-info, more information about cursors>>.
