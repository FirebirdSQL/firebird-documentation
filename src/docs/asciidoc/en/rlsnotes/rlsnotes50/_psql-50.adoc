== Allow subroutines to access variables/parameters defined at the outer/parent level
Adriano dos Santos Fernandes

Tracker ticket: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/4769[#4769]

Subroutines can now read from and write to variables and parameters of the outer/parent routine.
This does not apply to cursors: subroutines cannot access cursors of their parent.

Variables and parameters that are accessed by subroutines may have a small performance penalty (even in the main routine) when being read.

[NOTE]
====
The restriction on cursors may be lifted in a future version.

See tracker ticket https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7120[#7120].
