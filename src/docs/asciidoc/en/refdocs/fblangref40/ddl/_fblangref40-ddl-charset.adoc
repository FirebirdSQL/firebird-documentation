|===
^| Parameter
^| Description

|charset
|Character set identifier

|collation
|The name of the collation
|===

The `ALTER CHARACTER SET` statement changes the default collation for the specified character set.
It will affect the future usage of the character set, except for cases where the `COLLATE` clause is explicitly overridden.
In that case, the collation sequence of existing domains, columns and PSQL variables will remain intact after the change to the default collation of the underlying character set.

[NOTE]
====
If you change the default collation for the database character set (the one defined when the database was created), it will change the default collation for the database.

If you change the default collation for the character set that was specified during the connection, string constants will be interpreted according to the new collation value, except in those cases where the character set and/or the collation have been overridden.
