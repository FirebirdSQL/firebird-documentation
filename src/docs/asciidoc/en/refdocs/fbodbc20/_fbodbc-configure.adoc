[[fbodbc205-configure]]
= Firebird ODBC Configuration

The configuration settings you make in an ODBC data source description ("`DSN`") define the attributes for connecting to a specific database.
On Windows, a dialog box captures parameters that correspond to the connection attributes.
On Linux, the parameters are configured manually in text (`.ini`) files.

[[fbodbc205-config-windows]]
== Configuring a DSN on Windows

First, find the applets in the _Administrative Tools_ section of the machine where you are going to set up a "`channel`" through which your application program is going to connect with a Firebird database, either on the same machine or elsewhere in the local or wide-area network.

On a 64-bit machine, you will find two such applets:

[[fbodbc205-systemdsn-001]]
.Selecting a DSN setup applet on Windows
image::{docimagepath}/fb_odbc_system_dsn_001.png[scaledwidth=496px]

For the purpose of our example, we want to pick the item [term]_ODBC Data Sources (32-bit)_.
Obviously, if we had installed the 64-bit driver with the intention of using it for a 64-bit application, we would pick the 64-bit item from this menu instead. 

.Run as Administrator!
[IMPORTANT]
====
Don't left-click the item: right-click and, from the context menu, select menu:Run{sp}as{sp}Administrator[].
This is necessary because you are about to set up a _System DSN_.
====

Click on the tab labelled menu:System{sp}DSN[], where you will begin setting up your DSN.

[[fbodbc205-systemdsn-002]]
.Selecting the Firebird driver for the DSN 
image::{docimagepath}/fb_odbc_system_dsn_002.png[scaledwidth=498px]

Click btn:[Add...] on the first screen to bring up the list of drivers on the next.
Select the `Firebird/InterBase(r)` driver, then click btn:[Finish].

[[fbodbc205-config-windows-settings]]
=== The DSN Settings

After clicking btn:[Finish] on the previous screen, you are presented with a form into which you will enter the parameters for a connection and will be able to test that they all work.

.Parameters for the DSN Configuration
[cols="1,2", options="header", stripes="none]
|===
^| Parameter
^| Entry

|Data Source Name (DSN)
|REQUIRED.
A unique, meaningful name indicating the type of connection or its use.
Make it brief as you can expand the narrative elsewhere.
Examples: "`Connect from FbEmbed`" or "`ConnectFbServer`"

|Description
|Optional.
Can be used to provide more details about the data source.

|Database
|REQUIRED.
Full address of the database, as required for an embedded or network connection.
If the connection is remote, it can be in TCP/IP or WNET format.
TCP/IP is recommended.
Firebird database aliases are supported.
Refer to <<fbodbc205-examples-connection,Connection Examples>>.

|Client
|May be required.
Local path to the Firebird client library.
For embedded connections to a sub-V.3 Windows server, it can point to the copy of `fbembed.dll` in the application directory;
otherwise, point it to where you have located the bitness-compatible Firebird remote client library unless you are certain the correct library will be found automatically in a system location.

|Database Account
|Optional, since login credentials can be captured during connection to a Firebird database.
If it is not configured, the ODBC interface will prompt for a user ID (UID or USER) at connection time.

|Password
|Optional, since login credentials can be captured during connection to a Firebird database.
If it is configured, it should be the password for the supplied User ID.
Otherwise, the ODBC interface will prompt for a password (PWD or PASSWORD) at connection time.
Any password configured is encrypted automatically and saved in `odbc.ini`.
Storing the password here should not be a security risk.

|Role
|Optional.
If it is defined and the login is by SYSDBA, role is ignored;
otherwise, the login credentials, whether stored or captured at connection, must have been granted that role prior to the login attempt.

|Character Set
|May be blank.
Sets the default character set of the client.

2+^h|Options (set here in DSN or specify dynamically)

2+<h|Transaction parameters

|Read (default write)
|Transactions are read/write by default.
Check to make transactions read-only.

|Nowait (default wait)
|The transaction will wait if it encounters a lock conflict.
Check to have the transaction return an error immediately upon encountering a lock conflict.

|Lock timeout
|When a transaction is set for WAIT conflict resolution, express the length of time in seconds until the lock times out and a lock conflict error is returned (`isc_lock_timeout`).

2+<h|Other optional parameters

|Dialect
|SQL dialect for the client to use in accessing the database.
The only valid options for Firebird are 1 or 3.
Note, Dialect 1 is not compatible with quoted identifiers;
Dialect 3 will not accept strings delimited by double quotes.

|Quoted Identifier
|Causes pairs of double quotes to be treated solely as delimiters of case-sensitive object identifiers.
Attempts to pass double quotes as string delimiters will be treated as errors in both dialects.
Note, double-quoted strings have always been illegal in Dialect 3.

|Sensitive Identifier
|This option affects the way the client treats the property `SQL_IDENTIFIER_CASE`.
`SQL_IC_UPPER` (value=1) is the default, treating all identifiers as stored in upper case characters.
Check to select `SQL_IC_SENSITIVE`  (value=3) to have the interface treat all identifiers that are not in all upper case as though they were case-sensitive.
This is not recommended!
For an explanation, see <<#fbodbc20-note-sensitive-identifier,Note (1)>> below.

|Autoquoted Identifier
|Default is `NO`.
The effect of checking this is to change the setting to `YES`.
In that case, every identifier in every statement will be double-quoted automatically.
The need to set this on would be highly unusual and would need to be well understood to avoid non-stop errors.

|SCHEMA options
|Drop-down list offering three options for treatment of SQL schemas, which Firebird does not support.
Normally, leave this at the default setting menu:Set{sp}null{sp}field{sp}SCHEMA[].
For some details, see <<#fbodbc20-note-schema-setting,Note (2)>> below.
|===

[[fbodbc20-note-sensitive-identifier]]
.Note (1) regarding "`Sensitive identifier`"
[NOTE]
====
If this setting is checked on, it would cause this statement 

[source]
----
SELECT A.Test_Field FROM Mixed_Caps_Table A
ORDER BY A.Test_Field
----

to be converted to

[source]
----
SELECT A."Test_Field" FROM "Mixed_Caps_Table" A
ORDER BY A."Test_Field"
----

The following would result in a wrong conversion:

[source]
----
Select A.Test_Field From Mixed_Caps_Table A
Order By A.Test_Field
----

gets converted to

[source]
----
"Select" A."Test_Field" "From" "Mixed_Caps_Table" A
"Order" "By" A."Test_Field"
----
====

[[fbodbc20-note-schema-setting]]
.Note (2) regarding SCHEMA settings
[NOTE]
====
Some applications generate SQL statements automatically, based on user inquiries, on the assumption that the target database supports namespaces and SQL SCHEMAs.
For example,

[source]
----
select SYSDBA.COUNTRY,SYSDBA.CURRENCY from SYSDBA.COUNTRY
----

or

[source]
----
select * from SYSDBA.COUNTRY
----

This selection of schema settings attempts to prevent clashes with applications that do this kind of thing.
The drop-down list offers the three variants:

. Set null field SCHEMA
. Remove SCHEMA from SQL query
. Use full SCHEMA

menu:Set{sp}null{sp}field{sp}SCHEMA[] is the default, causing the SCHEMA element to be set `NULL` whenever it is specified as part of a query.
The result is a query that Firebird can process.

menu:Remove{sp}SCHEMA{sp}from{sp}SQL{sp}query[] filters the namespace references from the statement whenever the `SQLExecDirect` command receives a request such as

[source]
----
select SYSDBA.COUNTRY,SYSDBA.CURRENCY from SYSDBA.COUNTRY
----

transforming it before passing it to the API as

[source]
----
select COUNTRY,CURRENCY from COUNTRY
----

menu:Use{sp}full{sp}SCHEMA[]] is reserved for a future in which Firebird has the capability to process these concepts itself -- perhaps in Firebird 4.
In that event, the driver will have no need to screen out these constructions.

=== The Services Button

The Services button launches a number of server management utilities through a GUI management console.
It is described later in <<fbodbc205-services,The Services Interface>>. 

[[fbodbc205-linux-config]]
== Configuring a DSN on Linux
Pavel Cisar

Configuration depends on the Linux distribution but, somewhere in `/etc` or `/etc/unixODBC`, should be two files named `odbc.ini` and `odbcinst.ini`.

Add to odbcinst.ini:

[source]
----
[Firebird]
Description     = InterBase/Firebird ODBC Driver
Driver          = /usr/local/lib64/libOdbcFb.so
Setup           = /usr/local/lib64/libOdbcFb.so
Threading       = 1
FileUsage       = 1
CPTimeout       =
CPReuse         =
----

Add to odbc.ini:

[source]
----
[employee]
Description     = Firebird
Driver          = Firebird
Dbname          = localhost:/opt/firebird/examples/empbuild/employee.fdb
User            = SYSDBA
Password        = masterkey
Role            =
CharacterSet    =
ReadOnly        = No
NoWait          = No
----

[[fbodbc205-linux-config-test]]
=== Testing the Configuration

UnixODBC has a tool named `ISQL` (not to be confused with Firebird's tool of the same name!) that you can use to test the connection, as follows:

[source]
----
isql -v employee
----

If you have connection problems, make sure the directory where you placed the Firebird ODBC shared library, e.g. `/usr/local/lib64/libOdbcFb.so`, is on the system loadable library path.
If not you could set:

[source]
----
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/odbc
----

or, more simply,

[source]
----
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/odbc
----

If you still have problems, the next thing is to try an `strace` to try to identify them:

[source]
----
strace -o output.txt isql -v employee
----
