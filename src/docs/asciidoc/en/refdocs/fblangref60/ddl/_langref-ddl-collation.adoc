[#langref-ddl-collation]
= `COLLATION`

In SQL, text strings are sortable objects.
This means that they obey ordering rules, such as alphabetical order.
Comparison operations can be applied to such text strings (for example, "`less than`" or "`greater than`"), where the comparison must apply a certain sort order or collation.
For example, the expression "```'a' < 'b'```" means that '```'a'```' precedes '```'b'```' in the collation.
The expression "```'c' > 'b'```" means that '```'c'```' follows '```'b'```' in the collation.
Text strings of more than one character are sorted using sequential character comparisons: first the first characters of the two strings are compared, then the second characters, and so on, until a difference is found between the two strings.
This difference defines the sort order.

A `COLLATION` is the schema object that defines a collation (or sort order).

.`CREATE COLLATION` Statement Parameters
[cols="<1,<3", options="header",stripes="none"]
|===
^| Parameter
^| Description

|collname
|The name to use for the new collation.
The maximum length is 63 characters

|charset
|A character set present in the database

|basecoll
|A collation already present in the database

|extname
|The collation name used in the [path]`.conf` file
|===

The `CREATE COLLATION` statement does not "`create`" anything, its purpose is to make a collation known to a database.
The collation must already be present on the system, typically in a library file, and must be properly registered in a `.conf` file in the `intl` subdirectory of the Firebird installation.

The collation may alternatively be based on one that is already present in the database.

[#langref-ddl-collation-createhow]
=== How the Engine Detects the Collation

The optional `FROM` clause specifies the base collation that is used to derive a new collation.
This collation must already be present in the database.
If the keyword `EXTERNAL` is specified, then Firebird will scan the `.conf` files in `$fbroot/intl/`, where _extname_ must exactly match the name in the configuration file (case-sensitive).

If no `FROM` clause is present, Firebird will scan the `.conf` file(s) in the `intl` subdirectory for a collation with the collation name specified in `CREATE COLLATION`.
In other words, omitting the `FROM basecoll` clause is equivalent to specifying `FROM EXTERNAL ('__collname__')`.

The -- single-quoted -- _extname_ is case-sensitive and must correspond exactly with the collation name in the `.conf` file.
The _collname_, _charset_ and _basecoll_ parameters are case-insensitive unless enclosed in double-quotes.

When creating a collation, you can specify whether trailing spaces are included in the comparison.
If the `NO PAD` clause is specified, trailing spaces are taken into account in the comparison.
If the `PAD SPACE` clause is specified, trailing spaces are ignored in the comparison.

The optional `CASE` clause allows you to specify whether the comparison is case-sensitive or case-insensitive.

The optional `ACCENT` clause allows you to specify whether the comparison is accent-sensitive or accent-insensitive (e.g. if '```'e'```' and '```'Ã©'```' are considered equal or unequal).

[#langref-ddl-collation-specatt]
=== Specific Attributes

The `CREATE COLLATION` statement can also include specific attributes to configure the collation.
The available specific attributes are listed in the table below.
Not all specific attributes apply to every collation.
If the attribute is not applicable to the collation, but is specified when creating it, it will not cause an error.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Specific attribute names are case-sensitive.
====

In the table, "`1 bpc`" indicates that an attribute is valid for collations of character sets using 1 byte per character (so-called narrow character sets), and "`UNI`" for "`Unicode collations`".

[#langref-ddl-tbl-specific-colls]
.Specific Collation Attributes
[cols="<2,<1,<1,<3", options="header"]
|===
^| Atrribute
^| Values
^| Valid for
^| Comment

|`DISABLE-COMPRESSIONS`
|`0`, `1`
|1 bpc, UNI
|Disables compressions (a.k.a. contractions).
Compressions cause certain character sequences to be sorted as atomic units, e.g. Spanish c+h as a single character ch

|`DISABLE-EXPANSIONS`
|`0`, `1`
|1 bpc
|Disables expansions.
Expansions cause certain characters (e.g. ligatures or umlauted vowels) to be treated as character sequences and sorted accordingly

|`ICU-VERSION`
|default or M.m
|UNI
|Specifies the ICU library version to use.
Valid values are the ones defined in the applicable `<intl_module>` element in `intl/fbintl.conf`.
Format: either the string literal "`default`" or a major+minor version number like "`3.0`" (both unquoted).

|`LOCALE`
|xx_YY
|UNI
|Specifies the collation locale.
Requires complete version of ICU libraries.
Format: a locale string like "`du_NL`" (unquoted)

|`MULTI-LEVEL`
|`0`, `1`
|1 bpc
|Uses more than one ordering level

|`NUMERIC-SORT`
|`0`, `1`
|UNI
|Treats contiguous groups of decimal digits in the string as atomic units and sorts them numerically.
(This is also known as natural sorting)

|`SPECIALS-FIRST`
|`0`, `1`
|1 bpc
|Orders special characters (spaces, symbols etc.) before alphanumeric characters
|===

[TIP]
====
If you want to add a new character set with its default collation into your database, declare and run the stored procedure `sp_register_character_set(name, max_bytes_per_character)`, found in `misc/intl.sql` under the Firebird installation directory.

In order for this to work, the character set must be present on the system and registered in a `.conf` file in the `intl` subdirectory.

=== Who Can Create a Collation

The `CREATE COLLATION` statement can be executed by:

* <<langref-security-administrators,Administrators>>
* Users with the `CREATE COLLATION` privilege

The user executing the `CREATE COLLATION` statement becomes the owner of the collation.

|===
^| Parameter
^| Description

|collname

The `DROP COLLATION` statement removes the specified collation from the database, if it exists.
An error will be raised if the specified collation is not present.

[TIP]
====
If you want to remove an entire character set with all its collations from the database, declare and execute the stored procedure `sp_unregister_character_set(name)` from the `misc/intl.sql` subdirectory of the Firebird installation.
