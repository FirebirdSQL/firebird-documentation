[#langref-security-role]
= `ROLE`

A _role_ is a database object that packages a set of <<langref-security-privs,privileges>>.
Roles implement the concept of access control at a group level.
Multiple privileges are granted to the role and then that role can be granted to or revoked from one or many users, or even other roles.

A role that has been granted as a "`default`" role will be activated automatically.
Otherwise, a user must supply that role in their login credentials -- or with `SET ROLE` -- to exercise the associated privileges.
Any other privileges granted to the user directly are not affected by their login with the role.

Logging in with multiple explicit roles simultaneously is not supported, but a user can have multiple default roles active at the same time.

In this section the tasks of creating and dropping roles are discussed.

.`CREATE ROLE` Statement Parameter
[cols="<1,<3", options="header",stripes="none"]
|===
^| Parameter
^| Description

|rolename
|Role name.
The maximum length is 63 characters

|sys_privilege
|System privilege to grant
|===

The statement `CREATE ROLE` creates a new role object, to which one or more privileges can be granted subsequently.
The name of a role must be unique among the names of roles in the current database.

[WARNING]
====
It is advisable to make the name of a role unique among usernames as well.
The system will not prevent the creation of a role whose name clashes with an existing username, but if it happens, the user will be unable to connect to the database.

[#langref-security-role-createpriv]
=== Who Can Create a Role

The `CREATE ROLE` statement can be executed by:

* <<langref-security-administrators,Administrators>>
* Users with the `CREATE ROLE` privilege
** Setting system privileges also requires the system privilege `CREATE_PRIVILEGED_ROLES`

The user executing the `CREATE ROLE` statement becomes the owner of the role.

[#langref-security-role-create-exmpl]
=== `CREATE ROLE` Examples

.Creating a role named `SELLERS`
[source]
----
CREATE ROLE SELLERS;
----

.Creating a role `SELECT_ALL` with the system privilege to select from any selectable object
[source]
----
CREATE ROLE SELECT_ALL
  SET SYSTEM PRIVILEGES TO SELECT_ANY_OBJECT_IN_DATABASE;

== `ALTER ROLE`

Alters a role

ALTER ROLE _rolename_

[#langref-security-tbl-alterrole]
.`ALTER ROLE` Statement Parameter
[cols="<1,<3", options="header",stripes="none"]
|===
^| Parameter
^| Description

|rolename
|Role name;
specifying anything other than `RDB$ADMIN` will fail

|sys_privilege
|System privilege to grant
|===

`ALTER ROLE` can be used to grant or revoke system privileges from a role, or enable and disable the capability for Windows Administrators to assume <<langref-security-administrators,administrator privileges>> automatically when logging in.

This last capability can affect only one role: the system-generated role `RDB$ADMIN`.

For details on auto admin mapping, see <<langref-security-autoadminmapping,`AUTO ADMIN MAPPING`>>.

It is not possible to selectively grant or revoke system privileges.
Only the privileges listed in the `SET SYSTEM PRIVILEGES` clause will be available to the role after commit, and `DROP SYSTEM PRIVILEGES` will remove all system privileges from this role.

[#langref-security-role-alterpriv]
=== Who Can Alter a Role

The `ALTER ROLE` statement can be executed by:

* <<langref-security-administrators,Administrators>>
* Users with the `ALTER ANY ROLE` privilege, with the following caveats
** Setting or dropping system privileges also requires the system privilege `CREATE_PRIVILEGED_ROLES`
** Setting or dropping auto admin mapping also requires the system privilege `CHANGE_MAPPING_RULES`

[#langref-security-alterrole-exmpl]
=== `ALTER ROLE` Examples

.Drop all system privileges from a role named `SELECT_ALL`

[#langref-security-role-drop]
== `DROP ROLE`

Drops a role

.Available in
DSQL, ESQL

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
DROP ROLE _rolename_
----

The statement `DROP ROLE` deletes an existing role.
It takes a single argument, the name of the role.
Once the role is deleted, the entire set of privileges is revoked from all users and objects that were granted the role.

[#langref-security-role-droppriv]
=== Who Can Drop a Role

The `DROP ROLE` statement can be executed by:

* <<langref-security-administrators,Administrators>>
* The owner of the role
* Users with the `DROP ANY ROLE` privilege
