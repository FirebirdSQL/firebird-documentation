= Monitoring Tables

The Firebird engine can monitor activities in a database and make them available for user queries via the monitoring tables.
The definitions of these tables are always present in the database, all named with the prefix `MON$`.
The tables are virtual: they are populated with data only at the moment when the user queries them.
That is also one good reason why it is no use trying to create triggers for them!

The key notion in understanding the monitoring feature is an _activity snapshot_.
The activity snapshot represents the current state of the database at the start of the transaction in which the monitoring table query runs.
It delivers a lot of information about the database itself, active connections, users, transactions prepared, running queries and more.

The snapshot is created when any monitoring table is queried for the first time.
It is preserved until the end of the current transaction to maintain a stable, consistent view for queries across multiple tables, such as a master-detail query.
In other words, monitoring tables always behave as though they were in `SNAPSHOT TABLE STABILITY` ("`consistency`") isolation, even if the current transaction is started with a lower isolation level.

To refresh the snapshot, the current transaction must be completed and the monitoring tables must be re-queried in a new transaction context.

.Access Security
* SYSDBA and the database owner have full access to all information available from the monitoring tables
* Regular users can see information about their own connections;
other connections are not visible to them

[WARNING]
====
In a highly loaded environment, collecting information via the monitoring tables could have a negative impact on system performance.

[[fblangref-appx05-monattach-kill]]
=== Using `MON$ATTACHMENTS` to Kill a Connection

Monitoring tables are read-only.
However, the server has a built-in mechanism for deleting (and only deleting) records in the `MON$ATTACHMENTS` table, which makes it possible to close a connection to the database.

.Notes
[NOTE]
====
* All the current activity in the connection being deleted is immediately stopped and all active transactions are rolled back
* The closed connection will return an error with the `isc_att_shutdown` code to the application
* Later attempts to use this connection (i.e., use its handle in API calls) will return errors
====

.Example
Closing all connections except for your own (current):

=== Using `MON$STATEMENTS` to Cancel a Query

Monitoring tables are read-only.
However, the server has a built-in mechanism for deleting (and only deleting) records in the `MON$STATEMENTS` table, which makes it possible to cancel a running query.

.Notes
[NOTE]
====
* If no statements are currently being executed in the connection, any attempt to cancel queries will not proceed
* After a query is cancelled, calling execute/fetch API functions will return an error with the `isc_cancelled` code
* Subsequent queries from this connection will proceed as normal
====

.Example
Cancelling all active queries for the specified connection:

DELETE FROM MON$STATEMENTS
