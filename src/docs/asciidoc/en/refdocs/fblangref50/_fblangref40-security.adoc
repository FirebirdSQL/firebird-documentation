= Security

Databases must be secure and so must the data stored in them.
Firebird provides three levels of data security: user authentication at the server level, SQL privileges within databases, and -- optionally -- database encryption.
This chapter describes how to manage security at these three levels.

[NOTE]
====
There is also a fourth level of data security: wire protocol encryption, which encrypts data in transit between client and server.
Wire protocol encryption is out of scope for this Language Reference.
