= Procedural SQL (PSQL) Statements

Procedural SQL (PSQL) is a procedural extension of SQL.
This language subset is used for writing PSQL modules: stored procedures, stored functions, triggers, and PSQL blocks.

PSQL provides all the basic constructs of traditional structured programming languages, and also includes DML statements (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.), with a slightly modified syntax in some cases.

[[fblangref50-psql-elements]]
== Elements of PSQL

A PSQL module may contain declarations of local variables, subroutines and cursors, assignments, conditional statements, loops, statements for raising custom exceptions, error handling and sending messages (events) to client applications.
DML triggers have access to special context variables, two "`records`" that store, respectively, the `NEW` values for all columns during insert and update activity, and the `OLD` values during update and delete work, and three Boolean variables -- `INSERTING`, `UPDATING` and `DELETING` -- to determine the event that fired the trigger.

Statements that modify metadata (DDL) are not available in PSQL.

[[fblangref50-psql-elements-dml]]
=== DML Statements with Parameters

If DML statements (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.) in the body of a module (procedure, function, trigger or block) use parameters, only named parameters can be used.
If DML statements contain named parameters, then they must be previously declared as local variables using `DECLARE [VARIABLE]` in the declaration section of the module, or as input or output variables in the module header.

When a DML statement with parameters is included in PSQL code, the parameter name must be prefixed by a colon ('```:```') in most situations.
The colon is optional in statement syntax that is specific to PSQL, such as assignments and conditionals and the `INTO` clause.
The colon prefix on parameters is not required when calling stored procedures from within another PSQL module.

[[fblangref50-psql-elements-transacs]]
=== Transactions

Stored procedures and functions (including those defined in packages) are executed in the context of the transaction in which they are called.
Triggers are executed as an intrinsic part of the operation of the DML statement: thus, their execution is within the same transaction context as the statement itself.
Individual transactions are launched for database event triggers fired on connect or disconnect.

Statements that start and end transactions are not available in PSQL, but it is possible to run a statement or a block of statements in an autonomous transaction.

[[fblangref50-psql-elements-structure]]
=== Module Structure

PSQL code modules consist of a header and a body.
The DDL statements for defining them are __complex statements__;
that is, they consist of a single statement that encloses blocks of multiple statements.
These statements begin with a verb (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `RECREATE`, `CREATE OR ALTER`, or `EXECUTE BLOCK`) and end with the last `END` statement of the body.

[[fblangref50-psql-elements-header]]
==== The Module Header

The header provides the module name and defines any input and output parameters or -- for functions -- the return type.
Stored procedures and PSQL blocks may have input and output parameters.
Functions may have input parameters and must have a scalar return type.
Triggers do not have either input or output parameters, but DML triggers do have the `NEW` and `OLD` "`records`", and `INSERTING`, `UPDATING` and `DELETING` variables.

The header of a trigger indicates the DML event (insert, update or delete, or a combination) or DDL or database event and the phase of operation (`BEFORE` or `AFTER` that event) that will cause it to "`fire`".

[[fblangref50-psql-elements-body]]
==== The Module Body

The module body is either a PSQL module body, or an external module body.
PSQL blocks can only have a PSQL module body.

[[fblangref50-psql-elements-body-psql]]
===== The PSQL Module Body

The PSQL module body starts with an optional section that declares variables and subroutines, followed by a block of statements that run in a logical sequence, like a program.
A block of statements -- or compound statement -- is enclosed by the `BEGIN` and `END` keywords, and is executed as a single unit of code.
The main `BEGIN...END` block may contain any number of other `BEGIN...END` blocks, both embedded and sequential.
Blocks can be nested to a maximum depth of 512 blocks.
All statements except `BEGIN` and `END` are terminated by semicolons ('```;```').
No other character is valid for use as a terminator for PSQL statements.

[[fblangref50-sidebar01]]
.Switching the Terminator in _isql_
****
Here we digress a little, to explain how to switch the terminator character in the _isql_ utility to make it possible to define PSQL modules in that environment without conflicting with _isql_ itself, which uses the same character, semicolon ('```;```'), as its own statement terminator.

^| Description

|new_terminator
|New terminator

|old_terminator
|Old terminator
|===

When you write your triggers, stored procedures, stored functions or PSQL blocks in _isql_ -- either in the interactive interface or in scripts -- running a `SET TERM` statement is needed to switch the normal _isql_ statement terminator from the semicolon to another character or short string, to avoid conflicts with the non-changeable semicolon terminator in PSQL.
The switch to an alternative terminator needs to be done before you begin defining PSQL objects or running your scripts.

The alternative terminator can be any string of characters except for a space, an apostrophe or the current terminator character(s).
Any letter character(s) used will be case-sensitive.

.Example
Changing the default semicolon to '```^```' (caret) and using it to submit a stored procedure definition: character as an alternative terminator character:

[[fblangref50-psql-elements-body-ext]]
===== The External Module Body

The external module body specifies the UDR engine used to execute the external module, and optionally specifies the name of the UDR routine to call (_<extname>_) and/or a string (_<extbody>_) with UDR-specific semantics.

Configuration of external modules and UDR engines is not covered further in this Language Reference.
Consult the documentation of a specific UDR engine for details.

[[fblangref50-psql-storedprocs]]
== Stored Procedures

A stored procedure is executable code stored in the database metadata for execution on the server.
It can be called by other stored procedures (including itself), functions, triggers and client applications.
A procedure that calls itself is known as __recursive__.

[[fblangref50-psql-storedprocs-benefits]]
=== Benefits of Stored Procedures

Stored procedures have the following advantages: 

Modularity::
applications working with the database can use the same stored procedure, thereby reducing the size of the application code and avoiding code duplication.

Simpler Application Support::
when a stored procedure is modified, changes appear immediately to all host applications, without the need to recompile them if the parameters were unchanged.

Enhanced Performance::
since stored procedures are executed on a server instead of at the client, network traffic is reduced, which improves performance.

[[fblangref50-psql-storedprocs-types]]
=== Types of Stored Procedures

Firebird supports two types of stored procedures: _executable_ and _selectable_.

[[fblangref50-psql-storedprocs-executable]]
==== Executable Procedures

Executable procedures usually modify data in a database.
They can receive input parameters and return a single set of output (`RETURNS`) parameters.
They are called using the `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` statement.
See <<create-procedure-examples,an example of an executable stored procedure>> at the end of the <<fblangref50-ddl-proc-create,`CREATE PROCEDURE` section>> of xref:fblangref50-ddl[xrefstyle=full].

[[fblangref50-psql-storedprocs-selectable]]
==== Selectable Procedures

Selectable stored procedures usually retrieve data from a database, returning an arbitrary number of rows to the caller.
The caller receives the output one row at a time from a row buffer that the database engine prepares for it.

Selectable procedures can be useful for obtaining complex sets of data that are often impossible or too difficult or too slow to retrieve using regular DSQL `SELECT` queries.
Typically, this style of procedure iterates through a looping process of extracting data, perhaps transforming it before filling the output variables (parameters) with fresh data at each iteration of the loop.
A <<fblangref50-psql-suspend>> statement at the end of the iteration fills the buffer and waits for the caller to fetch the row.
Execution of the next iteration of the loop begins when the buffer has been cleared.

Selectable procedures may have input parameters, and the output set is specified by the `RETURNS` clause in the header.

A selectable stored procedure is called with a `SELECT` statement.
See <<create-procedure-examples,an example of a selectable stored procedure>> at the end of the <<fblangref50-ddl-proc-create,`CREATE PROCEDURE` section>> of xref:fblangref50-ddl[xrefstyle=full].

[[fblangref50-psql-storedprocs-creating]]
=== Creating a Stored Procedure

The syntax for creating executable stored procedures and selectable stored procedures is the same.
The difference comes in the logic of the program code, specifically the absence or presence of a <<fblangref50-psql-suspend>> statement.

For information about creating stored procedures, see <<fblangref50-ddl-proc-create,`CREATE PROCEDURE`>> in xref:fblangref50-ddl[xrefstyle=full].

[[fblangref50-psql-storedprocs-deleting]]
=== Dropping a Stored Procedure

For information about dropping (deleting) stored procedures, see <<fblangref50-ddl-proc-drop,`DROP PROCEDURE`>>.

[[fblangref50-psql-storedfuncs]]
== Stored Functions

A stored function is executable code stored in the database metadata for execution on the server.
It can be called by other stored functions (including itself), procedures, triggers, and client applications through DML statements.
A function that calls itself is known as __recursive__.

Unlike stored procedures, stored functions always return one scalar value.
To return a value from a stored function, use the `RETURN` statement, which immediately terminates the function.

[[fblangref50-psql-storedfuncs-create]]
=== Creating a Stored Function

For information about creating stored functions, see <<fblangref50-ddl-func-create,`CREATE FUNCTION`>> in xref:fblangref50-ddl[xrefstyle=full].

=== Dropping a Stored Function

[[fblangref50-psql-dynblocks]]
== PSQL Blocks

A self-contained, unnamed ("`anonymous`") block of PSQL code can be executed dynamically in DSQL, using the `EXECUTE BLOCK` syntax.
The header of a PSQL block may optionally contain input and output parameters.
The body may contain local variables, cursor declarations and local routines, followed by a block of PSQL statements, and is similar to a stored procedure.
A PSQL block cannot use a UDR module body.

A PSQL block is not defined and stored as an object, unlike stored procedures and triggers.
It executes in run-time and cannot reference itself.

Like stored procedures, anonymous PSQL blocks can be used to process data and to retrieve data from the database.

[[fblangref50-psql-package]]
== Packages

A package is a group of stored procedures and functions defined as a single database object.

Firebird packages are made up of two parts: a header (`PACKAGE` keyword) and a body (`PACKAGE BODY` keywords).
This separation is similar to Delphi modules;
the header corresponds to the interface part, and the body corresponds to the implementation part.

[[fblangref50-psql-pkg-benefits]]
=== Benefits of Packages

The notion of "`packaging`" the code components of a database operation addresses has several advantages:

Modularisation::
Blocks of interdependent code are grouped into logical modules, as done in other programming languages.
+
In programming, it is well recognised that grouping code in various ways, in namespaces, units or classes, for example, is a good thing.
This is not possible with standard stored procedures and functions in the database.
Although they can be grouped in different script files, two problems remain:
+
.. The grouping is not represented in the database metadata.
.. Scripted routines all participate in a flat namespace and are callable by everyone (we are not referring to security permissions here).

Easier tracking of dependencies::
Packages make it easy to track dependencies between a collection of related routines, as well as between this collection and other routines, both packaged and unpackaged.
+
Whenever a packaged routine determines that it uses a certain database object, a dependency on that object is registered in Firebird's system tables.
Thereafter, to drop, or maybe alter that object, you first need to remove what depends on it.
Since the dependency on other objects only exists for the package body, and not the package header, this package body can easily be removed, even if another object depends on this package.
When the body is dropped, the header remains, allowing you to recreate its body once the changes related to the removed object are done.

Simplify permission management::
As Firebird -- by default -- runs routines with the caller (invoker) privileges, it is necessary also to grant resource usage to each routine when these resources would not be directly accessible to the caller.
Usage of each routine needs to be granted to users and/or roles.
+
Packaged routines do not have individual privileges.
The privileges apply to the package as a whole.
Privileges granted to packages are valid for all package body routines, including private ones, but are stored for the package header.
An `EXECUTE` privilege on a package granted to a user (or other object), grants that user the privilege to execute all routines defined in the package header.
+
.For example
[source]
----
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE secret TO PACKAGE pk_secret;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PACKAGE pk_secret TO ROLE role_secret;
----

Private scopes::
Stored procedures and functions can be privates;
that is, make them available only for internal usage within the defining package.
+
All programming languages have the notion of routine scope, which is not possible without some form of grouping.
Firebird packages also work like Delphi units in this regard.
If a routine is not declared in the package header (interface) and is implemented in the body (implementation), it becomes a private routine.
A private routine can only be called from inside its package.

[[fblangref50-psql-pkg-create]]
=== Creating a Package

For information on creating packages, see <<fblangref50-ddl-pkg-create,`CREATE PACKAGE`>>, and <<fblangref50-ddl-pkg-body-create,`CREATE PACKAGE BODY`>> in xref:fblangref50-ddl[xrefstyle=full].

[[fblangref50-psql-pkg-alter]]
=== Modifying a Package

For information on modifying existing package header or bodies, see <<fblangref50-ddl-pkg-alter,`ALTER PACKAGE`>>, <<fblangref50-ddl-pkg-createalter,`CREATE OR ALTER PACKAGE`>>, <<fblangref50-ddl-pkg-recreate,`RECREATE PACKAGE`>>, and <<fblangref50-ddl-pkg-body-recreate,`RECREATE PACKAGE BODY`>>.

[[fblangref50-psql-pkg-drop]]
=== Dropping a Package

For information on dropping (deleting) a package, see <<fblangref50-ddl-pkg-drop,`DROP PACKAGE`>>, and <<fblangref50-ddl-pkg-body-drop,`DROP PACKAGE BODY`>>.

[[fblangref50-psql-triggers]]
== Triggers

A trigger is another form of executable code that is stored in the metadata of the database for execution by the server.
A trigger cannot be called directly.
It is called automatically ("`fired`") when data-changing events involving one particular table or view occur, or on a specific database or DDL event.

A trigger applies to exactly one table or view or database event, and only one _phase_ in an event (`BEFORE` or `AFTER` the event).
A single DML trigger might be written to fire only when one specific data-changing event occurs (`INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`), or it might be written to apply to more than one of those.

A DML trigger is executed in the context of the transaction in which the data-changing DML statement is running.
For triggers that respond to database events, the rule is different: for DDL triggers and transaction triggers, the trigger runs in the same transaction that executed the DDL, for other types, a new default transaction is started.

[[fblangref50-psql-firingorder]]
=== Firing Order (Order of Execution)

More than one trigger can be defined for each phase-event combination.
The order in which they are executed -- also known as "`firing order`" -- can be specified explicitly with the optional `POSITION` argument in the trigger definition.
You have 32,767 numbers to choose from.
Triggers with the lowest position numbers fire first.

If a `POSITION` clause is omitted, the position is `0`.
If multiple triggers have the same position and phase, those triggers will be executed in an undefined order, while respecting the total order by position and phase.

[[fblangref50-psql-dmltriggers]]
=== DML Triggers

DML triggers are those that fire when a DML operation changes the state of data: updating rows in tables, inserting new rows or deleting rows.
They can be defined for both tables and views.

[[fblangref50-psql-triggeroptions]]
==== Trigger Options

Six base options are available for the event-phase combination for tables and views: 

[[fblangref50-psql-tbl-dmltriggers]]
[%autowidth,cols="<1,<1m", frame="none", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|Before a new row is inserted
|BEFORE INSERT

|After a new row is inserted
|AFTER INSERT

|Before a row is updated
|BEFORE UPDATE

|After a row is updated
|AFTER UPDATE

|Before a row is deleted
|BEFORE DELETE

|After a row is deleted
|AFTER DELETE
|===

These base forms are for creating single phase/single-event triggers.
Firebird also supports forms for creating triggers for one phase and multiple-events, `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE`, for example, or `AFTER UPDATE OR DELETE`: the combinations are your choice.

"`Multiphase`" triggers, such as `BEFORE OR AFTER ...`, are not possible.

The Boolean context variables <<fblangref50-contextvars-inserting,`INSERTING`>>, <<fblangref50-contextvars-updating,`UPDATING`>> and <<fblangref50-contextvars-deleting,`DELETING`>> can be used in the body of a trigger to determine the type of event that fired the trigger.

[[fblangref50-psql-oldnew]]
==== `OLD` and `NEW` Context Variables

For DML triggers, the Firebird engine provides access to sets of `OLD` and `NEW` context variables (or, "`records`").
Each is a record of the values of the entire row: one for the values as they are before the data-changing event (the `BEFORE` phase) and one for the values as they will be after the event (the `AFTER` phase).
They are referenced in statements using the form `NEW.__column_name__` and `OLD.__column_name__`, respectively.
The _column_name_ can be any column in the table's definition, not just those that are being updated.

The `NEW` and `OLD` variables are subject to some rules:

* In all triggers, `OLD` is read-only
* In `BEFORE UPDATE` and `BEFORE INSERT` code, the `NEW` value is read/write, unless it is a `COMPUTED BY` column
* In `INSERT` triggers, references to `OLD` are invalid and will throw an exception
* In `DELETE` triggers, references to `NEW` are invalid and will throw an exception
* In all `AFTER` trigger code, `NEW` is read-only

[[fblangref50-psql-dbtriggers]]
=== Database Triggers

A trigger associated with a database or transaction event can be defined for the following events: 

[[fblangref50-psql-tbl-dbtriggers]]
[%autowidth,cols="<4,<3m,<5", frame="none", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|Connecting to a database
|ON CONNECT
|Before the trigger is executed, a transaction is automatically started with the default isolation level (snapshot (concurrency), write, wait)

|Disconnecting from a database
|ON DISCONNECT
|Before the trigger is executed, a transaction is automatically started with the default isolation level (snapshot (concurrency), write, wait)

|When a transaction is started
|ON TRANSACTION START
|The trigger is executed in the transaction context of the started transaction (immediately after start)

|When a transaction is committed
|ON TRANSACTION COMMIT
|The trigger is executed in the transaction context of the committing transaction (immediately before commit)

|When a transaction is cancelled
|ON TRANSACTION ROLLBACK
|The trigger is executed in the transaction context of the rolling back transaction (immediately before roll back)
|===

[[fblangref50-psql-ddltriggers]]
=== DDL Triggers

DDL triggers fire on specified metadata change events in a specified phase.
`BEFORE` triggers run before changes to system tables.
`AFTER` triggers run after changes to system tables.

DDL triggers are a specific type of database trigger, so most rules for and semantics of database triggers also apply for DDL triggers.

[[fblangref50-psql-ddltriggers-sem]]
==== Semantics

. `BEFORE` triggers are fired before changes to the system tables.
`AFTER` triggers are fired after system table changes.
+
.Important Rule
[IMPORTANT]
====
The event type `[BEFORE | AFTER]` of a DDL trigger cannot be changed.
====

. When a DDL statement fires a trigger that raises an exception (`BEFORE` or `AFTER`, intentionally or unintentionally) the statement will not be committed.
That is, exceptions can be used to ensure that a DDL operation will fail if the conditions are not precisely as intended.

. DDL trigger actions are executed only when _committing_ the transaction in which the affected DDL command runs.
Never overlook the fact that what is possible to do in an `AFTER` trigger is exactly what is possible to do after a DDL command without autocommit.
You cannot, for example, create a table and then use it in the trigger.

. With "```CREATE OR ALTER```" statements, a trigger is fired one time at the `CREATE` event or the `ALTER` event, according to the previous existence of the object.
With `RECREATE` statements, a trigger is fired for the `DROP` event if the object exists, and for the `CREATE` event.

. `ALTER` and `DROP` events are generally not fired when the object name does not exist.
For the exception, see point 6.

. The exception to rule 5 is that `BEFORE ALTER/DROP USER` triggers fire even when the username does not exist.
This is because, underneath, these commands perform DML on the security database, and the verification is not done before the command on it is run.
This is likely to be different with embedded users, so do not write code that depends on this.

. If an exception is raised after the DDL command starts its execution and before `AFTER` triggers are fired, `AFTER` triggers will not be fired.

. Packaged procedures and functions do not fire individual `++{CREATE | ALTER | DROP} {PROCEDURE | FUNCTION}++` triggers.

[[fblangref50-psql-ddltriggers-ctx]]

== Writing the Body Code

This section takes a closer look at the procedural SQL language constructs and statements that are available for coding the body of a stored procedure, functions, trigger, and PSQL blocks.

[sidebar]
.Colon Marker ('```:```')
****
The colon marker prefix ('```:```') is used in PSQL to mark a reference to a variable in a DML statement.
The colon marker is not required before variable names in other PSQL code.

The colon prefix can also be used for the `NEW` and `OLD` contexts, and for cursor variables.

=== Management Statements in PSQL

Management statement are allowed in PSQL modules (triggers, procedures, functions and PSQL blocks), which is especially helpful for applications that need management statements to be executed at the start of a session, specifically in `ON CONNECT` triggers.

The management statements permitted in PSQL are:

[none]
* <<fblangref50-management-session-reset-alter,`ALTER SESSION RESET`>>
* <<fblangref50-management-setbind,`SET BIND`>>
* <<fblangref50-management-setdecfloat,`SET DECFLOAT`>>
* <<fblangref50-management-role-set,`SET ROLE`>>
* <<fblangref50-management-setsessionidle,`SET SESSION IDLE TIMEOUT`>>
* <<fblangref50-management-setstatementtimeout,`SET STATEMENT TIMEOUT`>>
* <<fblangref50-management-settimezone,`SET TIME ZONE`>>
* <<fblangref50-management-role-set-trusted,`SET TRUSTED ROLE`>>

[CAUTION]
====
Although useful as a workaround, using `ON CONNECT` triggers to configure bind and time zone is usually not the right approach.
Alternatives are handling this through `DefaultTimeZone` in `firebird.conf` and `DataTypeCompatibility` in `firebird.conf` or `databases.conf`, or `isc_dpb_session_time_zone` or `isc_dpb_set_bind` in the DPB.

.`DECLARE VARIABLE` Statement Parameters
[cols="<1,<3", options="header",stripes="none"]
|===
^| Argument
^| Description

|varname
|Name of the local variable

|collation
|Collation

|initvalue
|Initial value for this variable

|literal
|Literal of a type compatible with the type of the local variable

|context_var
|Any context variable whose type is compatible with the type of the local variable
|===

The statement `DECLARE [VARIABLE]` is used for declaring a local variable.
One `DECLARE [VARIABLE]` statement is required for each local variable.
Any number of `DECLARE [VARIABLE]` statements can be included and in any order.
The name of a local variable must be unique among the names of local variables and input and output parameters declared for the module.

A special case of `DECLARE [VARIABLE]` -- declaring cursors -- is covered separately in <<fblangref50-psql-declare-cursor>>

[[fblangref50-psql-variable-type]]
==== Data Type for Variables

A local variable can be of any SQL type other than an array. 

* A domain name can be specified as the type;
the variable will inherit all of its attributes.
* If the `TYPE OF __domain__` clause is used instead, the variable will inherit only the domain's data type, and, if applicable, its character set and collation attributes.
Any default value or constraints such as `NOT NULL` or `CHECK` constraints are not inherited.
* If the `TYPE OF COLUMN __relation__.__column__` option is used to "`borrow`" from a column in a table or view, the variable will inherit only the column's data type, and, if applicable, its character set and collation attributes.
Any other attributes are ignored.

[[fblangref50-psql-variable-notnull]]
==== `NOT NULL` Constraint

For local variables, you can specify the `NOT NULL` constraint, disallowing `NULL` values for the variable.
If a domain has been specified as the data type and the domain already has the `NOT NULL` constraint, the declaration is unnecessary.
For other forms, including use of a domain that is nullable, the `NOT NULL` constraint can be included if needed.

[[fblangref50-psql-variable-charsetcollate]]
==== `CHARACTER SET` and `COLLATE` clauses

Unless specified, the character set and collation of a string variable will be the database defaults.
A `CHARACTER SET` clause can be specified to handle string data that needs a different character set.
A valid collation (`COLLATE` clause) can also be included, with or without the character set clause.

[[fblangref50-psql-variable-default]]
==== Initializing a Variable

Local variables are `NULL` when execution of the module begins.
They can be explicitly initialized so that a starting or default value is available when they are first referenced.
The initial value can be specified in two ways, `DEFAULT <initvalue>` and `= <initvalue>`.
The value can be any type-compatible literal or context variable, including `NULL`.

[TIP]
====
Be sure to use the `DEFAULT` clause for any variable that has a `NOT NULL` constraint and does not otherwise have a default value available (i.e. inherited from a domain).

|cursor_name

|select
|`SELECT` statement
|===

The `DECLARE ... CURSOR ... FOR` statement binds a named cursor to the result set obtained by the `SELECT` statement specified in the `FOR` clause.
In the body code, the cursor can be opened, used to iterate row-by-row through the result set, and closed.
While the cursor is open, the code can perform positioned updates and deletes using the `WHERE CURRENT OF` in the `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement.

Syntactically, the `DECLARE ... CURSOR` statement is a special case of <<fblangref50-psql-declare-variable>>.

[#fblangref50-psql-declare-cursor-types]
==== Forward-Only and Scrollable Cursors

The cursor can be forward-only (unidirectional) or scrollable.
The optional clause `SCROLL` makes the cursor scrollable, the `NO SCROLL` clause, forward-only.
By default, cursors are forward-only.

Forward-only cursors can -- as the name implies -- only move forward in the dataset.
Forward-only cursors only support the <<fblangref50-psql-fetch,`FETCH [NEXT FROM]`>> statement, other fetch options raise an error.
Scrollable cursors allow you to move not only forward in the dataset, but also back, as well as _N_ positions relative to the current position.

[WARNING]
====
Scrollable cursors are materialized as a temporary dataset, as such, they consume additional memory or disk space, so use them only when you really need them.
====

[[fblangref50-psql-idio-cursor]]
==== Cursor Idiosyncrasies

* The optional `FOR UPDATE` clause can be included in the `SELECT` statement, but its absence does not prevent successful execution of a positioned update or delete
* Care should be taken to ensure that the names of declared cursors do not conflict with any names used subsequently in statements for `AS CURSOR` clauses
* If the cursor is needed only to walk the result set, it is nearly always easier and less error-prone to use a `FOR SELECT` statement with the `AS CURSOR` clause.
Declared cursors must be explicitly opened, used to fetch data, and closed.
The context variable `ROW_COUNT` has to be checked after each fetch and, if its value is zero, the loop has to be terminated.
A `FOR SELECT` statement does this automatically.
+
Nevertheless, declared cursors provide a high level of control over sequential events and allow several cursors to be managed in parallel.
* The `SELECT` statement may contain parameters. For instance:
+
[source]
----
SELECT NAME || :SFX FROM NAMES WHERE NUMBER = :NUM
----
+
Each parameter has to have been declared beforehand as a PSQL variable, or as input or output parameters.
When the cursor is opened, the parameter is assigned the current value of the variable.

.Unstable Variables and Cursors
[WARNING]
====
If the value of the PSQL variable used in the `SELECT` statement of the cursor changes during the execution of the loop, then its new value may -- but not always -- be used when selecting the next rows.
It is better to avoid such situations.
If you really need this behaviour, then you should thoroughly test your code and make sure you understand how changes to the variable affect the query results.

Note particularly that the behaviour may depend on the query plan, specifically on the indexes being used.
Currently, there are no strict rules for this behaviour, and this may change in future versions of Firebird.

The `DECLARE FUNCTION` statement declares a sub-function.
A sub-function is only visible to the PSQL module that defined the sub-function.

A sub-function can use variables, but not cursors, from its parent module.
It can access other routines from its parent modules, including recursive calls to itself.

Sub-functions have a number of restrictions:

* A sub-function cannot be nested in another subroutine.
Subroutines are only supported in top-level PSQL modules (stored procedures, stored functions, triggers and PSQL blocks).
This restriction is not enforced by the syntax, but attempts to create nested sub-functions will raise an error "`__feature is not supported__`" with detail message "`__nested sub function__`".
* Currently, a sub-function has no direct access to use cursors from its parent module.

A sub-function can be forward declared to resolve mutual dependencies between subroutines, and must be followed by its actual definition.
When a sub-function is forward declared and has parameters with default values, the default values should only be specified in the forward declaration, and should not be repeated in _subfunc_def_.

[NOTE]
====
Declaring a sub-function with the same name as a stored function will hide that stored function from your module.
It will not be possible to call that stored function.

Contrary to `DECLARE [VARIABLE]`, a `DECLARE FUNCTION` is not terminated by a semicolon.

[listing]
----
<block> ::=
  BEGIN
    [<compound_statement> ...]
  END

<compound_statement> ::= {<block> | <statement>}
----

The `BEGIN ... END` construct is a two-part statement that wraps a block of statements that are executed as one unit of code.
Each block starts with the keyword `BEGIN` and ends with the keyword `END`.
Blocks can be nested a maximum depth of 512 nested blocks.
A block can be empty, allowing them to act as stubs, without the need to write dummy statements.

The `BEGIN ... END` itself should not be followed by a statement terminator (semicolon).
However, when defining or altering a PSQL module in the _isql_ utility, that application requires that the last `END` statement be followed by its own terminator character, that was previously switched -- using `SET TERM` -- to a string other than a semicolon.
That terminator is not part of the PSQL syntax.

The final, or outermost, `END` statement in a trigger terminates the trigger.
What the final `END` statement does in a stored procedure depends on the type of procedure: 

* In a selectable procedure, the final `END` statement returns control to the caller, returning SQLCODE 100, indicating that there are no more rows to retrieve
* In an executable procedure, the final `END` statement returns control to the caller, along with the current values of any output parameters defined.

PSQL does not provide more advanced multi-branch jumps, such as `CASE` or `SWITCH`.
However, it is possible to chain `IF ... THEN ... ELSE` statements, see the example section below.
Alternatively, the `CASE` statement from DSQL is available in PSQL and is able to satisfy at least some use cases in the manner of a switch:

|Optional label for `LEAVE` and `CONTINUE`.
Follows the rules for identifiers.

|condition
|A logical condition returning `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `UNKNOWN`

|compound_statement
|A single statement, or statements wrapped in `BEGIN ... END`
|===

A `WHILE` statement implements the looping construct in PSQL.
The statement or the block of statements will be executed as long as the condition returns `TRUE`.
Loops can be nested to any depth.

[[fblangref50-psql-while-exmpl]]
==== `WHILE ... DO` Examples

A procedure calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to `I` shows how the looping construct is used.

[[fblangref50-psql-exit]]
=== `EXIT`

Terminates execution of a module

.Syntax
[listing]
----
EXIT;
----

The `EXIT` statement causes execution of the current PSQL module to jump to the final `END` statement from any point in the code, thus terminating the program.

Calling `EXIT` in a function will result in the function returning `NULL`.

=== `SUSPEND`

Passes output to the buffer and suspends execution while waiting for caller to fetch it

.Syntax
[listing]
----
SUSPEND;
----

The `SUSPEND` statement is used in selectable stored procedures to pass the values of output parameters to a buffer and suspend execution.
Execution remains suspended until the calling application fetches the contents of the buffer.
Execution resumes from the statement directly after the `SUSPEND` statement.
In practice, this is likely to be a new iteration of a looping process. 

.Important Notes
[IMPORTANT]
====
. The `SUSPEND` statement can only occur in stored procedures or sub-procedures
. The presence of the `SUSPEND` keyword defines a stored procedure as a _selectable_ procedure
. Applications using interfaces that wrap the API perform the fetches from selectable procedures transparently.
. If a selectable procedure is executed using `EXECUTE PROCEDURE`, it behaves as an executable procedure.
When a `SUSPEND` statement is executed in such a stored procedure, it is the same as executing the `EXIT` statement, resulting in immediate termination of the procedure.
. `SUSPEND`"`breaks`" the atomicity of the block in which it is located.
If an error occurs in a selectable procedure, statements executed after the final `SUSPEND` statement will be rolled back.
Statements that executed before the final `SUSPEND` statement will not be rolled back unless the transaction is rolled back.

[cols="<1,<3", options="header",stripes="none"]
|===
^| Argument

|paramless_stmt
|Literal string or variable containing a non-parameterized SQL query

|stmt_with_params
|Literal string or variable containing a parameterized SQL query

|===

The statement `EXECUTE STATEMENT` takes a string parameter and executes it as if it were a DSQL statement.
If the statement returns data, it can be passed to local variables by way of an `INTO` clause.

`EXECUTE STATEMENT` can only produce a single row of data.
Statements producing multiple rows of data must be executed with <<fblangref50-psql-forexec>>.

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-wparams]]
==== Parameterized Statements

You can use parameters -- either named or positional -- in the DSQL statement string.
Each parameter must be assigned a value.

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-wparams01]]
===== Special Rules for Parameterized Statements

. Named and positional parameters cannot be mixed in one query
. Each parameter must be used in the statement text.
+
To relax this rule, named parameters can be prefixed with the keyword `EXCESS` to indicate that the parameter may be absent from the statement text.
This option is useful for dynamically generated statements that conditionally include or exclude certain parameters.
. If the statement has parameters, they must be enclosed in parentheses when `EXECUTE STATEMENT` is called, regardless of whether they come directly as strings, as variable names or as expressions
. Each named parameter must be prefixed by a colon ('```:```') in the statement string itself, but not when the parameter is assigned a value
. Positional parameters must be assigned their values in the same order as they appear in the query text
. The assignment operator for parameters is the special operator "```:=```", similar to the assignment operator in Pascal
. Each named parameter can be used in the statement more than once, but its value must be assigned only once
. With positional parameters, the number of assigned values must match the number of parameter placeholders (question marks) in the statement exactly
. A named parameter in the statement text can only be a regular identifier (it cannot be a quoted identifier)

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-wparms-exmpl]]
===== Examples of `EXECUTE STATEMENT` with parameters

. With named parameters:
+
[source]
----
...
DECLARE license_num VARCHAR(15);
DECLARE connect_string VARCHAR (100);
DECLARE stmt VARCHAR (100) =
  'SELECT license '
  'FROM cars '
  'WHERE driver = :driver AND location = :loc';
BEGIN
  -- ...
  EXECUTE STATEMENT (stmt)
    (driver := current_driver,
     loc := current_location)
  ON EXTERNAL connect_string
  INTO license_num;
----

. The same code with positional parameters:
+
[source]
----
DECLARE license_num VARCHAR (15);
DECLARE connect_string VARCHAR (100);
DECLARE stmt VARCHAR (100) =
  'SELECT license '
  'FROM cars '
  'WHERE driver = ? AND location = ?';
BEGIN
  -- ...
  EXECUTE STATEMENT (stmt)
    (current_driver, current_location)
  ON EXTERNAL connect_string
  INTO license_num;
----

. Use of `EXCESS` to allow named parameters to be unused (note: this is a `FOR EXECUTE STATEMENT`):

[source]
----
CREATE PROCEDURE P_EXCESS (A_ID INT, A_TRAN INT = NULL, A_CONN INT = NULL)
  RETURNS (ID INT, TRAN INT, CONN INT)
AS
DECLARE S VARCHAR(255) = 'SELECT * FROM TTT WHERE ID = :ID';
DECLARE W VARCHAR(255) = '';
BEGIN
  IF (A_TRAN IS NOT NULL)
  THEN W = W || ' AND TRAN = :a';

  IF (A_CONN IS NOT NULL)
  THEN W = W || ' AND CONN = :b';

  IF (W <> '')
  THEN S = S || W;

  -- could raise error if TRAN or CONN is null
  -- FOR EXECUTE STATEMENT (:S) (a := :A_TRAN, b := A_CONN, id := A_ID)

  -- OK in all cases
  FOR EXECUTE STATEMENT (:S) (EXCESS a := :A_TRAN, EXCESS b := A_CONN, id := A_ID)
    INTO :ID, :TRAN, :CONN
      DO SUSPEND;
END
----

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-wautonomous]]
==== `WITH {AUTONOMOUS | COMMON} TRANSACTION`

By default, the executed SQL statement runs within the current transaction.
Using `WITH AUTONOMOUS TRANSACTION` causes a separate transaction to be started, with the same parameters as the current transaction.
This separate transaction will be committed when the statement was executed without errors and rolled back otherwise.

The clause `WITH COMMON TRANSACTION` uses the current transaction whenever possible;
this is the default behaviour.
If the statement must run in a separate connection, an already started transaction within that connection is used, if available.
Otherwise, a new transaction is started with the same parameters as the current transaction.
Any new transactions started under the "```COMMON```" regime are committed or rolled back with the current transaction.

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-wcaller]]
==== `WITH CALLER PRIVILEGES`

By default, the SQL statement is executed with the privileges of the current user.
Specifying `WITH CALLER PRIVILEGES` combines the privileges of the calling procedure or trigger with those of the user, as if the statement were executed directly by the routine.
`WITH CALLER PRIVILEGES` has no effect if the `ON EXTERNAL` clause is also present.

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-onexternal]]
==== `ON EXTERNAL [DATA SOURCE]`

With `ON EXTERNAL [DATA SOURCE]`, the SQL statement is executed in a separate connection to the same or another database, possibly even on another server.
If _connection_string_ is NULL or "```''```" (empty string), the entire `ON EXTERNAL [DATA SOURCE]` clause is considered absent, and the statement is executed against the current database.

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-onext-connpool]]
===== Connection Pooling

* External connections made by statements `WITH COMMON TRANSACTION` (the default) will remain open until the current transaction ends.
They can be reused by subsequent calls to `EXECUTE STATEMENT`, but only if _connection_string_ is identical, including case
* External connections made by statements `WITH AUTONOMOUS TRANSACTION` are closed as soon as the statement has been executed
* Statements using `WITH AUTONOMOUS TRANSACTION` can and will re-use connections that were opened earlier by statements `WITH COMMON TRANSACTION`.
If this happens, the reused connection will be left open after the statement has been executed.
(It must be, because it has at least one active transaction!)

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-onext-transpool]]
===== Transaction Pooling

* If `WITH COMMON TRANSACTION` is in effect, transactions will be reused as much as possible.
They will be committed or rolled back together with the current transaction
* If `WITH AUTONOMOUS TRANSACTION` is specified, a fresh transaction will always be started for the statement.
This transaction will be committed or rolled back immediately after the statement's execution

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-onext-errhandling]]
===== Exception Handling

When `ON EXTERNAL` is used, the extra connection is always made via a so-called external provider, even if the connection is to the current database.
One of the consequences is that exceptions cannot be caught in the usual way.
Every exception caused by the statement is wrapped in either an `eds_connection` or an `eds_statement` error.
To catch them in your PSQL code, you have to use `WHEN GDSCODE eds_connection`, `WHEN GDSCODE eds_statement` or `WHEN ANY`.

Without `ON EXTERNAL`, exceptions are caught in the usual way, even if an extra connection is made to the current database.

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-onext-morenotes]]
===== Miscellaneous Notes

* The character set used for the external connection is the same as that for the current connection
* Two-phase commits are not supported

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-asuser]]
==== `AS USER`, `PASSWORD` and `ROLE`

The optional `AS USER`, `PASSWORD` and `ROLE` clauses allow specification of which user will execute the SQL statement and with which role.
The method of user login, and whether a separate connection is opened, depends on the presence and values of the `ON EXTERNAL [DATA SOURCE]`, `AS USER`, `PASSWORD` and `ROLE` clauses:

* If `ON EXTERNAL` is present, a new connection is always opened, and:
** If at least one of `AS USER`, `PASSWORD` and `ROLE` is present, native authentication is attempted with the given parameter values (locally or remotely, depending on _connection_string_).
No defaults are used for missing parameters
** If all three are absent, and _connection_string_ contains no hostname, then the new connection is established on the local server with the same user and role as the current connection.
The term 'local' means "`on the same machine as the server`" here.
This is not necessarily the location of the client
** If all three are absent, and _connection_string_ contains a hostname, then trusted authentication is attempted on the remote host (again, 'remote' from the perspective of the server).
If this succeeds, the remote operating system will provide the username (usually the operating system account under which the Firebird process runs)
* If `ON EXTERNAL` is absent:
** If at least one of `AS USER`, `PASSWORD` and `ROLE` is present, a new connection to the current database is opened with the supplied parameter values.
No defaults are used for missing parameters
** If all three are absent, the statement is executed within the current connection

If a parameter value is NULL or "```''```" (empty string), the entire parameter is considered absent.
Additionally, `AS USER` is considered absent if its value is equal to `CURRENT_USER`, and `ROLE` if it is the same as `CURRENT_ROLE`.

[[fblangref50-psql-execstmt-caveats]]
==== Caveats with `EXECUTE STATEMENT`

. There is no way to validate the syntax of the enclosed statement
. There are no dependency checks to discover whether tables or columns have been dropped
. Execution is considerably slower than when the same statements are executed directly as PSQL code
. Return values are strictly checked for data type to avoid unpredictable type-casting exceptions.
For example, the string `'1234'` would convert to an integer, 1234, but `'abc'` would give a conversion error

All in all, this feature is meant to be used cautiously, and you should always take the caveats into account.
If you can achieve the same result with PSQL and/or DSQL, it will almost always be preferable.

[cols="<1,<3", options="header",stripes="none"]
|===
^| Argument

|Optional label for `LEAVE` and `CONTINUE`.
Follows the rules for identifiers.

|select_stmt
|`SELECT` statement

|cursor_name
|Cursor name.
It must be unique among cursor names in the PSQL module (stored procedure, stored function, trigger or PSQL block)

|compound_statement
|A single statement, or statements wrapped in `BEGIN...END`, that performs all the processing for this `FOR` loop
|===

The `FOR SELECT` statement

* retrieves each row sequentially from the result set, and executes the statement or block of statements for each row.
In each iteration of the loop, the field values of the current row are copied into pre-declared variables.
+ 
Including the `AS CURSOR` clause enables positioned deletes and updates to be performed -- see notes below
* can embed other `FOR SELECT` statements
* can contain named parameters that must be previously declared in the `DECLARE VARIABLE` statement or exist as input or output parameters of the procedure
* requires an `INTO` clause at the end of the `SELECT ... FROM ...` specification if `AS CURSOR` is absent
In each iteration of the loop, the field values of the current row are copied to the list of variables specified in the `INTO` clause.
The loop repeats until all rows are retrieved, after which it terminates
* can be terminated before all rows are retrieved by using a `BREAK`, `LEAVE` or `EXIT` statement

[[fblangref50-psql-undeclaredcursor]]
==== The Undeclared Cursor

The optional `AS CURSOR` clause surfaces the result set of the `FOR SELECT` structure as an undeclared, named cursor that can be operated on using the `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause inside the statement or block following the `DO` command, to delete or update the current row before execution moves to the next row.
In addition, it is possible to use the cursor name as a record variable (similar to `OLD` and `NEW` in triggers), allowing access to the columns of the result set (i.e. __cursor_name__.__columnname__).

// When updating, also update the same list in fblangref50-psql-fetch
.Rules for Cursor Variables
* When accessing a cursor variable in a DML statement, the colon prefix can be added before the cursor name (i.e. `:__cursor_name__.__columnname__`) for disambiguation, similar to variables.
+
The cursor variable can be referenced without colon prefix, but in that case, depending on the scope of the contexts in the statement, the name may resolve in the statement context instead of to the cursor (e.g. you select from a table with the same name as the cursor).
* Cursor variables are read-only
* In a `FOR SELECT` statement without an `AS CURSOR` clause, you must use the `INTO` clause.
If an `AS CURSOR` clause is specified, the `INTO` clause is allowed, but optional;
you can access the fields through the cursor instead.
* Reading from a cursor variable returns the current field values.
This means that an `UPDATE` statement (with a `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause) will update not only the table, but also the fields in the cursor variable for subsequent reads.
Executing a `DELETE` statement (with a `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause) will set all fields in the cursor variable to `NULL` for subsequent reads

Other points to take into account regarding undeclared cursors: 

. The `OPEN`, `FETCH` and `CLOSE` statements cannot be applied to a cursor surfaced by the `AS CURSOR` clause
. The _cursor_name_ argument associated with an `AS CURSOR` clause must not clash with any names created by `DECLARE VARIABLE` or `DECLARE CURSOR` statements at the top of the module body, nor with any other cursors surfaced by an `AS CURSOR` clause
. The optional `FOR UPDATE` clause in the `SELECT` statement is not required for a positioned update

|cursor_name
|Cursor name.
A cursor with this name must be previously declared with a `DECLARE CURSOR` statement
|===

An `OPEN` statement opens a previously declared cursor, executes its declared `SELECT` statement, and makes the first record of the result data set ready to fetch.
`OPEN` can be applied only to cursors previously declared in a <<fblangref50-psql-declare-cursor>> statement.

If the `SELECT` statement of the cursor has parameters, they must be declared as local variables, or input or output parameters before the cursor is declared.
When the cursor is opened, the parameter is assigned the current value of the variable.

.`FETCH` Statement Parameters
[cols="<1,<3", options="header",stripes="none"]
|===
^| Argument
^| Description

|cursor_name
|Cursor name.
A cursor with this name must be previously declared with a `DECLARE ... CURSOR` statement and opened by an `OPEN` statement.

|varname
|Variable name

|n
|Integer expression for the number of rows
|===

The `FETCH` statement fetches the next row from the result set of the cursor and assigns the column values to PSQL variables.
The `FETCH` statement can be used only with a cursor declared with the <<fblangref50-psql-declare-cursor>> statement.

Using the optional _fetch_scroll_ part of the `FETCH` statement, you can specify in which direction and how many rows to advance the cursor position.
The `NEXT` fetch option can be used for scrollable and forward-only cursors.
Other fetch options are only supported for scrollable cursors.

.The Fetch Options
`NEXT`::
moves the cursor one row forward;
this is the default

`PRIOR`::
moves the cursor one record back

`FIRST`::
moves the cursor to the first record.

`LAST`::
moves the cursor to the last record

`RELATIVE __n__`::
moves the cursor _n_ rows from the current position;
positive numbers move forward, negative numbers move backwards;
using zero (`0`) will not move the cursor, and `ROW_COUNT` will be set to zero as no new row was fetched.

`ABSOLUTE __n__`::
moves the cursor to the specified row;
_n_ is an integer expression, where `1` indicates the first row.
For negative values, the absolute position is taken from the end of the result set, so `-1` indicates the last row, `-2` the second to last row, etc.
A value of zero (`0`) will position before the first row.

The optional `INTO` clause gets data from the current row of the cursor and loads them into PSQL variables.
If a fetch moves beyond the bounds of the result set, the variables will be set to `NULL`.

It is also possible to use the cursor name as a variable of a record type (similar to `OLD` and `NEW` in triggers), allowing access to the columns of the result set (i.e. __cursor_name__.__columnname__).

// When updating also update the same list in fblangref50-psql-undeclaredcursor
.Rules for Cursor Variables
* When accessing a cursor variable in a DML statement, the colon prefix can be added before the cursor name (i.e. `:__cursor_name__.__columnname__`) for disambiguation, similar to variables.
+
The cursor variable can be referenced without colon prefix, but in that case, depending on the scope of the contexts in the statement, the name may resolve in the statement context instead of to the cursor (e.g. you select from a table with the same name as the cursor).
* Cursor variables are read-only
* In a `FOR SELECT` statement without an `AS CURSOR` clause, you must use the `INTO` clause.
If an `AS CURSOR` clause is specified, the `INTO` clause is allowed, but optional;
you can access the fields through the cursor instead.
* Reading from a cursor variable returns the current field values.
This means that an `UPDATE` statement (with a `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause) will update not only the table, but also the fields in the cursor variable for subsequent reads.
Executing a `DELETE` statement (with a `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause) will set all fields in the cursor variable to `NULL` for subsequent reads
// Don't include in fblangref50-psql-undeclaredcursor
* When the cursor is not positioned on a row -- it is positioned before the first row, or after the last row -- attempts to read from the cursor variable will result in error "`__Cursor *cursor_name* is not positioned in a valid record__`"

For checking whether all the rows of the result set have been fetched, the context variable `ROW_COUNT` returns the number of rows fetched by the statement.
If a record was fetched, then `ROW_COUNT` is one (`1`), otherwise zero (`0`).

The `IN AUTONOMOUS TRANSACTION` statement enables execution of a statement or a block of statements in an autonomous transaction.
Code running in an autonomous transaction will be committed right after its successful execution, regardless of the status of its parent transaction.
This can be used when certain operations must not be rolled back, even if an error occurs in the parent transaction.

An autonomous transaction has the same isolation level as its parent transaction.
Any exception that is thrown in the block of the autonomous transaction code will result in the autonomous transaction being rolled back and all changes made will be undone.
If the code executes successfully, the autonomous transaction will be committed.

[[fblangref50-psql-handleexceptions]]
== Trapping and Handling Errors

Firebird has a useful lexicon of PSQL statements and resources for trapping errors in modules and for handling them.
Firebird uses built-in exceptions that are raised for errors occurring when working DML and DDL statements.

In PSQL code, exceptions are handled by means of the `WHEN` statement.
Handling an exception in the code involves either fixing the problem in situ, or stepping past it;
either solution allows execution to continue without returning an exception message to the client.

An exception results in execution being terminated in the current block.
Instead of passing the execution to the `END` statement, the procedure moves outward through levels of nested blocks, starting from the block where the exception is caught, searching for the code of the handler that "`knows`" about this exception.
It stops searching when it finds the first `WHEN` statement that can handle this exception.

[[fblangref50-ddl-sysexcept]]
=== System Exceptions

An exception is a message that is generated when an error occurs.

All exceptions handled by Firebird have predefined numeric values for context variables (symbols) and text messages associated with them.
Error messages are output in English by default.
Localized Firebird builds are available, where error messages are translated into other languages.

Complete listings of the system exceptions can be found in xref:fblangref50-appx02-errorcodes[xrefstyle=full]:

* <<fblangref50-appx02-sqlstates,SQLSTATE Error Codes and Descriptions>>
* <<fblangref50-appx02-sqlcodes,"GDSCODE Error Codes, SQLCODEs and Descriptions">>

[[fblangref50-ddl-customexcept]]
=== Custom Exceptions

Custom exceptions can be declared in the database as persistent objects and called in PSQL code to signal specific errors;
for example, to enforce certain business rules.
A custom exception consists of an identifier, and a default message of 1021 bytes.
For details, see <<fblangref50-ddl-exception-create,`CREATE EXCEPTION`>>.

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]

.`EXCEPTION` Statement Parameters
[cols="<1,<3", options="header",stripes="none"]
|===
^| Argument
^| Description

|exception_name
|Exception name

|custom_message
|Alternative message text to be returned to the caller interface when an exception is thrown.
Maximum length of the text message is 1,021 bytes

|val
|Value expression that replaces parameter slots in the exception message text
|===

The `EXCEPTION` statement with _exception_name_ throws the user-defined exception with the specified name.
An alternative message text of up to 1,021 bytes can optionally override the exception's default message text.

The default exception message can contain slots for parameters that can be filled when throwing an exception.
To pass parameter values to an exception, use the `USING` clause.
Considering, in left-to-right order, each parameter passed in the exception-raising statement as "`the __N__th`", with _N_ starting at 1:

* If the __N__th parameter is not passed, its slot is not replaced
* If a `NULL` parameter is passed, the slot will be replaced with the string "```++*** null ***++```"
* If more parameters are passed than are defined in the exception message, the surplus ones are ignored
* The maximum number of parameters is 9
* The maximum message length, including parameter values, is 1053 bytes

The status vector is generated as the code combination `isc_except, <exception number>, isc_formatted_exception, <formatted exception message>, <exception parameters>`.

The error code used (`isc_formatted_exception`) was introduced in Firebird 3.0, so the client must be at least version 3.0, or at least use the `firebird.msg` from version 3.0 or higher, to translate the status vector to a string.

[WARNING]
====
If the _message_ contains a parameter slot number that is greater than 9, the second and subsequent digits will be treated as literal text.
For example `@10` will be interpreted as slot 1 followed by a literal '```0```'.

As an example:

[source]
----
CREATE EXCEPTION ex1
  'something wrong in @1@2@3@4@5@6@7@8@9@10@11';
SET TERM ^;
EXECUTE BLOCK AS
BEGIN
  EXCEPTION ex1 USING ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i');
END^
----

This will produce the following output

[listing]
----
Statement failed, SQLSTATE = HY000
exception 1
-EX1
-something wrong in abcdefghia0a1
----
====

Exceptions can be handled in a <<fblangref50-psql-when>> statement.
If an exception is not handled in a module, then the effects of the actions executed inside this module are cancelled, and the caller program receives the exception (either the default text, or the custom text).

Within the exception-handling block -- and only within it -- the caught exception can be re-thrown by executing the `EXCEPTION` statement without parameters.
If located outside the block, the re-thrown `EXCEPTION` call has no effect.

Custom exceptions are stored in the system table <<fblangref-appx04-exceptions,`RDB$EXCEPTIONS`>>.

.`WHEN ... DO` Statement Parameters
[cols="<1,<3", options="header",stripes="none"]
|===
^| Argument
^| Description

|exception_name
|Exception name

|number
|SQLCODE error code

|errcode
|Symbolic GDSCODE error name

|sqlstate_code
|String literal with the SQLSTATE error code

|compound_statement
|A single statement, or a block of statements
|===

The `WHEN ... DO` statement handles Firebird errors and user-defined exceptions.
The statement catches all errors and user-defined exceptions listed after the keyword `WHEN` keyword.
If `WHEN` is followed by the keyword `ANY`, the statement catches any error or user-defined exception, even if they have already been handled in a `WHEN` block located higher up.

The `WHEN ... DO` statements must be located at the end of a block of statements, before the block's `END` statement, and after any other statement.

The keyword `DO` is followed by a single statement, or statements wrapped in a `BEGIN ... END` block, that handles the exception.
The `SQLCODE`, `GDSCODE`, and `SQLSTATE` context variables are available in the context of this statement or block.
Use the <<fblangref50-scalarfuncs-rdberror,`RDB$ERROR`>> function to obtain the SQLCODE, GDSCODE, SQLSTATE, custom exception name and exception message.
The `EXCEPTION` statement, without parameters, can also be used in this context to re-throw the error or exception.

[[fblangref50-psql-when-gdscode]]
.Targeting `GDSCODE`
****
The argument for the `WHEN GDSCODE` clause is the symbolic name associated with the internally-defined exception, such as `grant_obj_notfound` for GDS error `335544551`.

In a statement or block of statements of the `DO` clause, a `GDSCODE` context variable, containing the numeric code, becomes available.
That numeric code is required if you want to compare a `GDSCODE` exception with a targeted error.
To compare it with a specific error, you need to use a numeric values, for example `335544551` for `grant_obj_notfound`.

Similar context variables are available for `SQLCODE` and `SQLSTATE`.
****

The `WHEN ... DO` statement or block is only executed when one of the events targeted by its conditions occurs at run-time.
If the `WHEN ... DO` statement is executed, even if it does nothing, execution will continue as if no error occurred: the error or user-defined exception neither terminates nor rolls back the operations of the trigger or stored procedure.

However, if the `WHEN ... DO` statement or block does nothing to handle or resolve the error, the DML statement (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`) that caused the error will be rolled back and none of the statements below it in the same block of statements are executed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
. If the error is not caused by one of the DML statements (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`), the entire block of statements will be rolled back, not only the one that caused an error.
Any operations in the `WHEN ... DO` statement will be rolled back as well.
The same limitation applies to the `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` statement.
Read an interesting discussion of the phenomenon in Firebird Tracker ticket https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/4803[firebird#4803^].
. In selectable stored procedures, output rows that were already passed to the client in previous iterations of a `FOR SELECT ... DO ... SUSPEND` loop remain available to the client if an exception is thrown subsequently in the process of retrieving rows.
====

[[fblangref50-psql-whendo-scope]]
==== Scope of a `WHEN ... DO` Statement

A `WHEN ... DO` statement catches errors and exceptions in the current block of statements.
It also catches exceptions from nested blocks, if those exceptions have not been handled in those blocks.

All changes made before the statement that caused the error are visible to a `WHEN ... DO` statement.
However, if you try to log them in an autonomous transaction, those changes are unavailable, because the transaction where the changes took place is not committed at the point when the autonomous transaction is started.
Example 4, below, demonstrates this behaviour.

[TIP]
====
When handling exceptions, it is sometimes desirable to handle the exception by writing a log message to mark the fault and having execution continue past the faulty record.
Logs can be written to regular tables, but there is a problem with that: the log records will "`disappear`" if an unhandled error causes the module to stop executing, and a rollback is performed.
Use of <<fblangref50-ddl-tbl-external,external tables>> can be useful here, as data written to them is transaction-independent.
The date inserted into a linked external file will still be there, regardless of whether the overall process succeeds or not.
