The journal directory is a _working directory_ where the Firebird server stores its journal files for the primary for asynchronous replication.

This setting should not be specified when only using synchronous replication.

The journal directory is for use by the primary **only**;
this directory and its contents should not be referenced, accessed or modified by the replica (or anything else).

When asynchronous replication is used, journal files (or, replication segments) are moved to the <<fbconf-repl-journal-archive-directory,journal archive directory>> or using a <<fbconf-repl-journal-archive-command,custom archiving command>> when they are ready to be replicated to (consumed by) the replica.
