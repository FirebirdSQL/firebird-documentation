[#fbconf-repl-cascade-replication]
= `cascade_replication`

Configures if changes applied to the replica will be subject to further replication (if any configured).

.Syntax

----
cascade_replicaton = _Boolean_

.Default
`false`

This setting only has an effect if the replica is also configured as a primary.

If disabled (the default), changes applied from incoming replication are not replicated.
Only changes directly applied to the (read-write) replica (i.e. changes to the database by means other than replication) will be replicated to the "`next`" replica(s).

If enabled, the changes applied from incoming replication and changes directly applied to the replica will be replicated to the "`next`" replica(s).
