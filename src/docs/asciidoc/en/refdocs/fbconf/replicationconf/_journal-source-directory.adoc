The replica searches the journal source directory for files to apply.

If there is only a single replica, the directory specified in this configuration item can be the same directory as specified in <<fbconf-repl-journal-archive-directory>> of the primary.
This can -- for example -- be done by mounting or otherwise sharing the directory between both hosts.

If you have multiple replicas, each replica must have its own copy of the journal archive, and use its own directory.
Replicas will delete journal files they no longer need, which can conflict with the needs of another replica.
