By default, asynchronous replication will (try to) apply all journal files -- from any primary -- that shows up in the <<fbconf-repl-journal-source-directory>>.

This setting can be used to only apply journal files from a specific primary, using its database GUID (e.g. as shown on the header page of https://firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/html/en/firebirddocs/gstat/firebird-gstat.html#gstat-cmdline-header[`gstat -h`]).

[CAUTION]
====
The double quotes and braces around the GUID are required!
