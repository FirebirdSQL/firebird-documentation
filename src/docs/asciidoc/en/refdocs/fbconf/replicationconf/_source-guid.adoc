[#fbconf-repl-source-guid]
= `source_guid`

Filter to limit replication to the particular source database (based on its GUID).

.Replication type
Asynchronous

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
source_guid = <quoted-guid>

<quoted-guid> ::= '"{' _guid_ '}"'
----

By default, asynchronous replication will (try to) apply all journal files -- from any primary -- that shows up in the <<fbconf-repl-journal-source-directory>>.

This setting can be used to only apply journal files from a specific primary, using its database GUID (e.g. as shown on the header page of `gstat -h`).

[CAUTION]
====
The double quotes and brackets around the GUID are required!

.Example
[listing]
----
source_guid = "{8FA6D945-BE7E-4376-86D7-E4AAF3889FAF}"
