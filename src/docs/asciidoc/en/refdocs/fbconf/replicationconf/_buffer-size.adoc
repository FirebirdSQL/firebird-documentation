The bigger this value, the less concurrent disk access (related to journal IOPS) happens.

For synchronous replication, it also affects number of network round-trips between primary and replica hosts.
However, a larger buffer results in a longer replication "`checkpoint`" (delay to synchronize the original database with its replica at commit).
