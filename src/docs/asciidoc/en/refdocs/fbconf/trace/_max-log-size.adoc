[#fbconf-trace-max-log-size]
= `max_log_size`

Maximum size of log files (in megabytes).

.Trace type
`database`, `services`

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
max_log_size = _integer_
----

.Unit
Megabyte (MiB)

.Default
`0` (unlimited)

When the maximum log file size is reached, the log is rotated by renaming it to include the current date and time.
A new log file with the name configured by <<fbconf-trace-log-filename>> is created.

A value of `0` (zero, the default) means that the file size is unlimited, and no rotation will occur.

This configuration item is only available for system trace configuration.
For limiting user trace sizes, specify <<fbconf-max-user-trace-log-size>> in `firebird.conf`.
