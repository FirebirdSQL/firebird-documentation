[#fbconf-env-visual]
= `VISUAL`

Default text editor for _isql_ (non-Windows OSes only).

.Configuration
Client

If `VISUAL` is not set, the value of <<fbconf-env-editor>> is checked before using the default.

The environment variable `VISUAL` is ignored on Windows.

.Default if neither `VISUAL` nor `EDITOR` is set:
[horizontal.compact]
Windows:: `Notepad`
Linux and other OSes:: `vi`

This is *not* a Firebird-specific environment variable, but a common convention for applications.
