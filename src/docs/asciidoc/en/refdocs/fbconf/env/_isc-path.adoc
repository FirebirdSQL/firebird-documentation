[#fbconf-env-isc-path]
= `ISC_PATH`

Path for resolving databases with a filename *without* a path component.

.Configuration
Server/Embedded

Firebird will resolve filenames *without* a path component in the directory specified by `ISC_PATH`.
This is done only when the name did not match an alias.

To determine if a file has a path component, Firebird checks if a file contains a `:`, `/` or `\`.

If `ISC_PATH` is *not* set, and <<fbconf-database-access>> is set to `Restrict`, filenames *without* a path component are resolved against its list of directories.
