[#fbconf-env-editor]
= `EDITOR`

Default text editor for _isql_.

.Configuration
Client

On Linux and other non-Windows OSes, `EDITOR` is only used if <<fbconf-env-visual>> is not set.

.Default if neither `VISUAL` nor `EDITOR` is set:
[horizontal.compact]
Windows:: `Notepad`
Linux and other OSes:: `vi`

This is *not* a Firebird-specific environment variable, but a common convention for applications.
