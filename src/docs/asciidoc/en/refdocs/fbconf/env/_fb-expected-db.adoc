[#fbconf-env-fb-expected-db]
= `FB_EXPECTED_DB`

Default value of the "`expected database`" for Services Manager connections for use of a non-default security database.

.Configuration
Client

The value of this environment variable is a database alias or path.
It is used -- client-side -- to set the value of SPB item `isc_spb_expected_db` if it was not explicitly set.

When establishing a Services Manager connection, the server looks up the `databases.conf` entry of the "`expected database`", and uses its value of <<fbconf-security-database>> as the security database.
// TODO Does it also determine AuthServer and WireCrypt settings?
If there is no `databases.conf` entry, or the entry has no value for `SecurityDatabase`, the value from `firebird.conf` is used.
