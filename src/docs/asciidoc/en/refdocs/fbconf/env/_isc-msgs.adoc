[#fbconf-env-isc-msgs]
= `ISC_MSGS`

Path of the Firebird message file.

.Configuration
Client, Server/Embedded

This setting is primarily a client-side setting, but may get used by the server if it formats and prints messages itself.

The `ISC_MSGS` -- if set -- must point to a Firebird message file, not to a directory.

For details on resolution of Firebird message files, see <<fbconf-concept-msg-file-resolve>> in <<fbconf-env-firebird-msg>>.
