[#fbconf-env-icu-timezone-files-dir]
= `ICU_TIMEZONE_FILES_DIR`

Override location of ICU timezone data files.

.Configuration
Server/Embedded, Client

Most Firebird builds will look for the ICU timezone data files in directory `tzdata` in the Firebird root directory (on Android, in the root directory itself).
Builds can have overridden this default location with the `FB_TZDATADIR` define in their build configuration.

If for some reason you need to use an alternative location for these files, you can configure this with environment variable `ICU_TIMEZONE_FILES_DIR`.

In general, updating the timezone database should be done by replacing the `{asterisk}.res` files in this `tzdata` directory.
