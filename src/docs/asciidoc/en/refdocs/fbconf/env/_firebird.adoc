[#fbconf-env-firebird]
= `FIREBIRD`

Overrides the Firebird root directory.

.Configuration
Client, Server/Embedded

The Firebird root directory determines where the server or client reads other configuration (e.g. `firebird.conf`) from.
It also serves as the default location for ``firebird.msg``footnote:[Build configuration may define another default location for the message file.], if not overridden by <<fbconf-env-firebird-msg>> or <<fbconf-env-isc-msgs>>

In general, this should only be set or changed to configure clients and embedded instances, not servers.
An incorrect root directory for the server may result in the server using incorrect configuration, or not being able to load required plugins and other components.

// TODO Can we be more specific on how the root directory is determined? Should we? Exact resolution and determination of this root directory is rather opaque to me.
