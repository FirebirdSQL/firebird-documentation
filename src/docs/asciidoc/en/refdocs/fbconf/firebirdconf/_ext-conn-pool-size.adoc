The external connections pool is a connection pool for the external data source (EDS) subsystem.
For details, consult https://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/release_notes/html/en/4_0/rlsnotes40.html#rnfb40-connection-pool[Pooling of External Connections] in the _Firebird 3.0 Release Notes_.

As the connection pool is per process, for Classic this means it is effectively per connection.
