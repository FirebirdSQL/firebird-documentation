[#fbconf-database-growth-increment]
= `DatabaseGrowthIncrement`

Maximum database growth increment in bytes.

.Configuration
Global, and per-database

.Syntax
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
DatabaseGrowthIncrement = _integer_

.Unit
Byte

.Default
`128M` (128 MiB)

When a database has to allocate a database page, and there are no free pages, Firebird will allocate space with the following constraints:

* Minimum: 128 KiB
* 1/16th of existing allocated space
* Maximum: value of `DatabaseGrowthIncrement`

Preallocation reduces physical file fragmentation, and may improve performance.

If `DatabaseGrowthIncrement` is set to zero (`0`), preallocation is disabled, and Firebird will then allocate space per page.

Database shadow files are not preallocated.
