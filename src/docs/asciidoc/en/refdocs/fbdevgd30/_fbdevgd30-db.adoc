[[fbdevgd30-database]]
= The examples.fdb Database

Before we explore the process of creating applications in various programming languages, we will walk through the creation and preparation of the database that  is used as the back-end to all of the sample projects.

The applications work with a database based on the model illustrated in this diagram:

[#db-diagram.text-center]
.Model of the examples.fdb database
image::{docimagepath}/fbdevgd30_db_001_en.png[align="center",pdfwidth="100%"]

.Disclaimer
[NOTE]
====
This chapter does not attempt to provide a tutorial about database design or SQL syntax.
The model is made as simple as possible to avoid cluttering the application development techniques with topics about database modeling and development.
We hope some readers might be enlightened by our approach to maintaining interrelated data using stored procedures.
The scripts are all here for you to refer to as you work  your way through the projects.

The requirements for your real-life projects are undoubtedly different from and much more complicated than those for our example projects.
====

[[fbdevg30-db-create]]
== Database Creation Script

The tool used here to create the database from a script is _isql_, that is installed with all the other executables in every Firebird server installation.
You could use any other administration tool for Firebird, such as FlameRobin, SQLLY Studio, IBExpert or others.

We will assume that you are working in Windows.
Obviously, the formats of path names will differ on other file systems (Linux, Apple Mac, etc.) but the _isql_ tool works the same on all platforms.

Run _isql_ and enter the following script after the `SQL>` prompt appears:

[source]
----
CREATE DATABASE 'localhost:D:\fbdata\2.5\examples.fdb'
USER 'SYSDBA' PASSWORD 'masterkey'
PAGE_SIZE 8192 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET UTF8;
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The straight single quotes around the user and password arguments are not optional in Firebird 2.5 and lower versions because, in the `CREATE DATABASE` syntax, both are strings.

In Firebird 3, the rules changed.
User names became identifiers and no longer require single quotes.
They can be made case-sensitive by enclosing the name in DOUBLE quotes, so you need to be aware of how that user is registered in the security database.
Passwords are still strings.

Quotes in the statement are not interchangeable with curly quotes, angle quotes or any other kind of quotes.
====

The user whose name and password are cited in the CREATE DATABASE statement becomes the owner of the database and has full access to all metadata objects.
It is not essential that SYSDBA be the owner of a database.
Any user can be the owner, which has the same access as SYSDBA in this database.

The actively supported versions of Firebird support the following page sizes: 4096, 8192 and 16384.
The page size of 8192 is good for most cases.

The optional `DEFAULT CHARACTER SET` clause specifies the default character set for string data types.
Character sets are applied to the `CHAR`, `VARCHAR` and `BLOB SUB_TYPE TEXT` data types.
You can study the list of available language encodings in an https://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/html/en/refdocs/fblangref25/firebird-25-language-reference.html#fblangref25-appx06-charsets[Appendix to the Firebird Language Reference] manual.
All up-to-date programming languages support UTF8, so we choose this encoding.

Now we can exit the _isql_ session by typing the following command: 

----
EXIT;
----

[[fbdevg30-db-aliases]]
=== Database Aliases

Databases are accessed locally and remotely by their physical file path on the server.
Before you start to use a database, it is useful and wise to register an alias for its file path and to use the alias for all connections.
It saves typing and, to some degree, it offers a little extra security from snoopers by obscuring the physical location of your database file in the connection string.

In Firebird 2.5, the alias of a database is registered in the `aliases.conf` file as follows: 

----
examples = D:\fbdata\2.5\examples.fdb
----

In Firebird 3.0, the alias of a database is registered in the `databases.conf` file.
Along with the alias for the database, some database-level parameters can be configured there: page cache size, the size of RAM for sorting and several others, e.g., 

----
examples = D:\fbdata\3.0\examples.fdb
{
    DefaultDbCachePages = 16K
    TempCacheLimit = 512M
}
----

[TIP]
====
You can use an alias even before the database exists.
It is valid to substitute the full file path with the alias in the `CREATE DATABASE` statement.
====

[[fbdevg30-db-crt-db-objects]]
== Creating the Database Objects

Now let us create a script for building the database objects.

[[fbdevg30-db-crt-domains]]
=== Domains

First, we define some domains that we will use in column definitions.

[source]
----
CREATE DOMAIN D_BOOLEAN AS
SMALLINT
CHECK (VALUE IN (0, 1));

COMMENT ON DOMAIN D_BOOLEAN IS
'Boolean type. 0 - FALSE, 1- TRUE';

CREATE DOMAIN D_MONEY AS
NUMERIC(15,2);

CREATE DOMAIN D_ZIPCODE AS
CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET UTF8
CHECK (TRIM(TRAILING FROM VALUE) SIMILAR TO '[0-9]+');

COMMENT ON DOMAIN D_ZIPCODE IS
'Zip code';
----

[[fbdevg30-db-boolean]]
==== `BOOLEAN` Type

In Firebird 3.0, there is a native `BOOLEAN` type.
Some drivers do not support it, due to its relatively recent appearance in Firebird's SQL lexicon.
With that in mind, our applications will be built on a database that will work with either Firebird 2.5 or Firebird 3.0.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before Firebird 3, servers could connect clients to databases that were created under older Firebird versions.
Firebird 3 can connect only to databases that were created on or restored under Firebird 3.
====

[[fbdevg30-db-primary-tables]]
=== Primary Tables

Now let us proceed to the primary tables.
The first will be the `CUSTOMER` table.
We will create a sequence (a generator) for its primary key and a corresponding trigger for implementing it as an auto-incrementing column.
We will do the same for each of the tables.

[source]
----
CREATE GENERATOR GEN_CUSTOMER_ID;

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (
  CUSTOMER_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  NAME VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
  ADDRESS VARCHAR(250),
  ZIPCODE D_ZIPCODE,
  PHONE VARCHAR(14),
  CONSTRAINT PK_CUSTOMER PRIMARY KEY (CUSTOMER_ID)
);

SET TERM ^ ;

CREATE OR ALTER TRIGGER CUSTOMER_BI FOR CUSTOMER
ACTIVE BEFORE INSERT POSITION 0
AS
BEGIN
  IF (NEW.CUSTOMER_ID IS NULL) THEN
    NEW.CUSTOMER_ID = NEXT VALUE FOR GEN_CUSTOMER_ID;
END
^

SET TERM ; ^

COMMENT ON TABLE CUSTOMER IS
'Customers';

COMMENT ON COLUMN CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID IS
'Customer Id';

COMMENT ON COLUMN CUSTOMER.NAME IS
'Name';

COMMENT ON COLUMN CUSTOMER.ADDRESS IS
'Address';

COMMENT ON COLUMN CUSTOMER.ZIPCODE IS
'Zip Code';

COMMENT ON COLUMN CUSTOMER.PHONE IS
'Phone';
----

[NOTE]
====
* In Firebird 3.0, you can use `IDENTITY` columns as auto-incremental fields. The script for creating the table would then be as follows:
+
[source]
----

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (
  CUSTOMER_ID INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  NAME VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
  ADDRESS VARCHAR(250),
  ZIPCODE D_ZIPCODE,
  PHONE VARCHAR(14),
  CONSTRAINT PK_CUSTOMER PRIMARY KEY (CUSTOMER_ID)
);
----
* In Firebird 3.0, you need the `USAGE` privilege to use a sequence (generator), so you will have to add the following line to the script:
+
[source]
----
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE GEN_CUSTOMER_ID TO TRIGGER CUSTOMER_BI;
----
====

Now we construct a script for creating the `PRODUCT` table:

[source]
----
CREATE GENERATOR GEN_PRODUCT_ID;

CREATE TABLE PRODUCT (
  PRODUCT_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  PRICE D_MONEY NOT NULL,
  DESCRIPTION BLOB SUB_TYPE 1 SEGMENT SIZE 80,
  CONSTRAINT PK_PRODUCT PRIMARY KEY (PRODUCT_ID)
);

SET TERM ^;

CREATE OR ALTER TRIGGER PRODUCT_BI FOR PRODUCT
ACTIVE BEFORE INSERT POSITION 0
AS
BEGIN
  IF (NEW.PRODUCT_ID IS NULL) THEN
    NEW.PRODUCT_ID = NEXT VALUE FOR GEN_PRODUCT_ID;
END
^

SET TERM ;^

COMMENT ON TABLE PRODUCT IS
'Goods';

COMMENT ON COLUMN PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID IS
'Product Id';

COMMENT ON COLUMN PRODUCT.NAME IS
'Name';

COMMENT ON COLUMN PRODUCT.PRICE IS
'Price';

COMMENT ON COLUMN PRODUCT.DESCRIPTION IS
'Description';
----

[NOTE]
====
In Firebird 3.0, you need to add the command for granting the `USAGE` privilege for a sequence (generator) to the script:

[source]
----
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE GEN_PRODUCT_ID TO TRIGGER PRODUCT_BI;
----
====

[[fbdevg30-db-secondary-tables]]
=== Secondary Tables

The script for creating the `INVOICE` table:

[source]
----
CREATE GENERATOR GEN_INVOICE_ID;

CREATE TABLE INVOICE (
  INVOICE_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CUSTOMER_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  INVOICE_DATE TIMESTAMP,
  TOTAL_SALE D_MONEY,
  PAID D_BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_INVOICE PRIMARY KEY (INVOICE_ID)
);

ALTER TABLE INVOICE ADD CONSTRAINT FK_INVOCE_CUSTOMER
FOREIGN KEY (CUSTOMER_ID) REFERENCES CUSTOMER (CUSTOMER_ID);

CREATE INDEX INVOICE_IDX_DATE ON INVOICE (INVOICE_DATE);

SET TERM ^;

CREATE OR ALTER TRIGGER INVOICE_BI FOR INVOICE
ACTIVE BEFORE INSERT POSITION 0
AS
BEGIN
  IF (NEW.INVOICE_ID IS NULL) THEN
    NEW.INVOICE_ID = GEN_ID(GEN_INVOICE_ID,1);
END
^

SET TERM ;^

COMMENT ON TABLE INVOICE IS
'Invoices';

COMMENT ON COLUMN INVOICE.INVOICE_ID IS
'Invoice number';

COMMENT ON COLUMN INVOICE.CUSTOMER_ID IS
'Customer Id';

COMMENT ON COLUMN INVOICE.INVOICE_DATE IS
'The date of issuance invoices';

COMMENT ON COLUMN INVOICE.TOTAL_SALE IS
'Total sum';

COMMENT ON COLUMN INVOICE.PAID IS
'Paid';
----

The `INVOICE_DATE` column is indexed because we will be filtering invoices by date to enable the records to be selected by a work period that will be application-defined by a start date and an end date.

[NOTE]
====
In Firebird 3.0, you need to add the command for granting the `USAGE` privilege for a sequence (generator) to the script:

[source]
----
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE GEN_INVOICE_ID TO TRIGGER INVOICE_BI;
----
====

The script for creating the `INVOICE_LINE` table:

[source]
----
CREATE GENERATOR GEN_INVOICE_LINE_ID;

CREATE TABLE INVOICE_LINE (
  INVOICE_LINE_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  INVOICE_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRODUCT_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  QUANTITY NUMERIC(15,0) NOT NULL,
  SALE_PRICE D_MONEY NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_INVOICE_LINE PRIMARY KEY (INVOICE_LINE_ID)
);

ALTER TABLE INVOICE_LINE ADD CONSTRAINT FK_INVOICE_LINE_INVOICE
FOREIGN KEY (INVOICE_ID) REFERENCES INVOICE (INVOICE_ID);

ALTER TABLE INVOICE_LINE ADD CONSTRAINT FK_INVOICE_LINE_PRODUCT
FOREIGN KEY (PRODUCT_ID) REFERENCES PRODUCT (PRODUCT_ID);

SET TERM ^;

CREATE OR ALTER TRIGGER INVOICE_LINE_BI FOR INVOICE_LINE
ACTIVE BEFORE INSERT POSITION 0
AS
BEGIN
  IF (NEW.INVOICE_LINE_ID IS NULL) THEN
    NEW.INVOICE_LINE_ID = NEXT VALUE FOR GEN_INVOICE_LINE_ID;
END
^

SET TERM ;^

COMMENT ON TABLE INVOICE_LINE IS

'Product Id';

COMMENT ON COLUMN INVOICE_LINE.QUANTITY IS

COMMENT ON COLUMN INVOICE_LINE.SALE_PRICE IS

----

[NOTE]
====
In Firebird 3.0, you need to add the command for granting the `USAGE` privilege for a sequence (generator) to the script:

[source]
----
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE GEN_INVOICE_LINE_ID TO TRIGGER INVOICE_LINE_BI;
----
====

[[fbdevg30-db-stored-procs]]

[[fbdevg30-db-stored-procs-edit-inv]]
==== Editing an invoice

The procedure for editing an invoice is a bit more complicated.
We will include a rule to block further editing of an invoice once it is paid.
We will create an exception that will be raised if an attempt is made to modify a paid invoice.

[[fbdevg30-db-user-privs]]
=== Roles and Privileges for Users

Now we need to create roles and grant the corresponding privileges.
We will create two roles: `MANAGER` and `SUPERUSER`.
`MANAGER` will have a limited set of privileges while `SUPERUSER` will have access to practically everything in the database that is used by the project application.

[source]
----
CREATE ROLE MANAGER;
CREATE ROLE SUPERUSER;
-- The MANAGER role can read any table and use the corresponding procedures
-- to manage invoices:
GRANT SELECT ON CUSTOMER TO MANAGER;
GRANT SELECT ON INVOICE TO MANAGER;
GRANT SELECT ON INVOICE_LINE TO MANAGER;
GRANT SELECT ON PRODUCT TO MANAGER;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE SP_ADD_INVOICE TO MANAGER;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE SP_ADD_INVOICE_LINE TO MANAGER;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE SP_DELETE_INVOICE TO MANAGER;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE SP_DELETE_INVOICE_LINE TO MANAGER;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE SP_EDIT_INVOICE TO MANAGER;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE SP_EDIT_INVOICE_LINE TO MANAGER;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE SP_PAY_FOR_INVOICE TO MANAGER;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE GEN_INVOICE_ID TO MANAGER;
-- The SUPERUSER role can read any table, edit the primary tables directly
-- and use the procedures to manage invoices:
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON CUSTOMER TO SUPERUSER;
GRANT SELECT ON INVOICE TO SUPERUSER;
GRANT SELECT ON INVOICE_LINE TO SUPERUSER;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON PRODUCT TO SUPERUSER;

GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE GEN_CUSTOMER_ID TO SUPERUSER;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE GEN_INVOICE_ID TO SUPERUSER;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE GEN_PRODUCT_ID TO SUPERUSER;

These statements create some users and assign roles to them:

[source]
----
CREATE USER IVAN PASSWORD 'z12a';
CREATE USER ANNA PASSWORD 'lh67';

GRANT MANAGER TO ANNA;
GRANT MANAGER TO IVAN WITH ADMIN OPTION;
GRANT SUPERUSER TO IVAN;
----

The user `IVAN` can assign the `MANAGER` role to other users.

[[fbdevg30-db-run-script]]
== Saving and Running the Script

Save our script to a text file named `examples.sql`.

Now you have three choices: you can 

* download the ready-made script files using the following links:
** https://github.com/sim1984/example-db_2_5/archive/1.0.zip
** or https://github.com/sim1984/example-db_3_0/archive/1.0.zip
* OR run the script `examples.sql` that you just created yourself;
* OR download the ready-made database, complete with sample data.
Links are provided at the end of this chapter.

Now, to run our script in the database created earlier:

[source]
----
isql -user sysdba -password masterkey "localhost:examples"
         -i "d:\examples-db\examples.sql"
----

[WARNING]
====
Do not split this command!
====

The argument `"localhost:examples"` uses an alias in place of the file path.
It assumes that an alias named '```examples```' actually exists, of course!
The `-i` switch is an abbreviation of `-input` and its argument should be the path to the script file you just saved.

[[fbdevg30-db-load-test-data]]
== Loading Test Data

Now that the database is created and built, you can populate it with test data.
Various tools are available to help with that.
If you prefer not to do it yourself, you can download a copy of the built database already loaded with the test data we used in the sample projects, from one of the following links: 

* https://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/examples/en/fbdevgd30/db_2_5.zip[db_2_5.zip]
* or https://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/examples/en/fbdevgd30/db_3_0.zip[db_3_0.zip]

.Reminder
[WARNING]
====
A database built by Firebird 2.5 will not be accessible by a Firebird 3 server, nor vice versa.
Make sure you download the correct database for your needs.
====
