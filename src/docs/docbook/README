README for the DocBook Stylesheets

These are XSL stylesheets for the DocBk XML DTD. (They would
also work for the DocBook DTD, modulo certain namecase problems
and the fact that there aren't (yet) any XSL implementations
that work with SGML source documents.)

As of version 1.0, most of the elements in DocBook are handled
in some way or another, usually reasonably, but there's still
lots of work to be done.
