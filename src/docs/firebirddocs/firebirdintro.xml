			<title>About Firebird</title>
			<para>Firebird is a relational database product with a history stretching back to the mid 1980s, when Jim Starkey, then working for DEC, realized that transaction isolation could be provided without locking by storing multiple record versions within the database.  After several changes in ownership, the source code to what was by then known as InterBase was released in open source by Inprise/Borland in July 2000.  The Firebird project has formed to continue open development of this database.</para>
