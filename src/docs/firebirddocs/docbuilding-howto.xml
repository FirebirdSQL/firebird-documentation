    <title>Introduction: Purpose of this Howto – Intended audience</title>

    <para>This Howto explains, step by step, how you can download and build the
    firebird-documentation repository from the Firebird Project.</para>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-intro-what">
      <title>What is this "firebird-documentation repository" anyway?</title>

      <para>The firebird-documentation repository is part of the Firebird Project on GitHub: <ulink
      url="https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird-documentation">https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird-documentation</ulink>.
      It is a collective effort, aimed at producing comprehensive and accurate documentation on the
      Firebird RDBMS (Relational Database Management System).</para>

      <para>It is important to understand that the firebird-documentation repository contains the
      documentation in <emphasis>source form</emphasis> – to be more precise: in DocBook XML format.
      These sources need to be processed (<firstterm>built</firstterm>) to obtain easily readable
      docs, which can then be published on the Internet.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-intro-otherdocs">
      <title>Apart from the firebird-documentation repository, is there any other Firebird
      documentation?</title>

      <para>Yes! At the time of this writing, most useful Firebird documentation has been produced
      outside the Firebird manual module. We still have a long way to go before the documentation in
      the manual module will be anywhere near complete. In fact, one of the reasons this Howto is
      written is that it can help would-be docwriters to overcome their first hurdles.</para>

      <para>If you are looking for ready Firebird documentation and lots of it, your best starting
      places are:</para>

          <para><ulink
          url="https://www.firebirdsql.org/en/documentation/">https://www.firebirdsql.org/en/documentation/</ulink>

          – a listing of other sites with valuable Firebird documentation.</para>

      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-intro-readydocs">
      <title>Do I really have to build the docs myself? Isn't there an easier way?</title>

      <para>Sure there's an easier way. As soon as a piece of documentation reaches a certain level
      of maturity, it is published – in PDF and HTML – on the Firebird website. You can find all the
      docs we have published via the Firebird Documentation Index (see link above).</para>

      <para>You should download the manual module and build the docs yourself if and only if:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>You want to check on the absolutely latest state of the docs. (Be aware though that
          one of the reasons a version has not yet been published may be that it contains
          errors.)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You want to help write documentation yourself.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You're interested in learning how this doc building stuff works, and/or you think
          DIY is more fun than an easy file download.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If one of the above applies to your situation, this Howto is for you.</para>

    <title>Getting the firebird-documentation repository from GitHub</title>

    <titleabbrev>Getting the firebird-documentation repository from SF</titleabbrev>

    <para>The firebird-documentation repository is a repository on the Firebird Project on GitHub.
    In order to download it, you need a piece of software called a <firstterm>git
    client</firstterm>. This section describes the necessary steps to get the software and the
    firebird-documentation repository. The actual doc building will be discussed in the next main
    section: <xref linkend="docbuildhowto-building-the-docs"/>.</para>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-whatisgit">
      <title>What is git?</title>

      <para>Git is a distributed version control system. It is a tool to manage software
      development, useful both for single developers and for teamwork. The Firebird Project on
      GitHub is divided into several so-called <firstterm>repositories</firstterm>, the
      firebird-documentation repository being one of them.</para>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-git-clients">
      <title>Git clients</title>

      <para>Downloading a repository from GitHub is called <firstterm>cloning a
      repository</firstterm> in git lingo. To do that, you need a git client; they exist for
      practically every operating system. Here's a list of git clients for some popular OSes:</para>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-checking-out">
      <title>Checking out the firebird-documentation repository</title>

      <para>If you only want to build the documentation, you can <firstterm>clone</firstterm> the
      repository to your local machine and build from there. If you want to contribute, there are
      two ways of contributing to a repository: contributing through a <firstterm>pull
      request</firstterm> from a <firstterm>fork</firstterm> of the repository, or working directly
      on the repository.</para>

      <para>The common method of contributing on GitHub is through so-called pull request. With a
      pull request, you don't commit directly to the original repository. Instead, you fork the
      repository to your own GitHub account, make your changes on this fork, and then create a pull
      request to ask for those changes to be incorporated in the repository of the Firebird
      Project.</para>

      <para>Working directly on the repository is similar to using a fork. The main difference is
      that working directly on the repository is more suitable for trusted regular contributors,
      while pull requests are very suitable for occasional or one-off contributions. To be able to
      work directly on the repository requires that you have been given commit-access to the
      repository, while anyone can create a pull request.</para>

      GitHub</ulink>.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Java Runtime Environment, Standard Edition version 8 or earlier– often abbreviated
          as JRE SE.</para>

          <para>Go to <ulink url="https://www.java.com/">https://www.java.com/</ulink> and follow
          the links to the download pages. Get the version for your own OS. Clicking on a "Download"
          or "Get it now" link may lead to windows popping up, asking you if it's OK that Oracle
          installs stuff on your computer. If you agree, practically everything will be installed
          automatically. If that makes you feel uneasy, you can also download the installation
          program manually and run it yourself.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Java Software Development Kit, Standard Edition version 8 or earlier – or JDK
          SE.</para>

          <para>This is a much larger package, and it also contains the JRE SE. If you want the SDK,
          go to <ulink

          and get the latest stable version. When you have to choose between JRE and JDK, take the
          JDK. (Yes, you can also get the JRE from here, but you can get it easier and quicker from
          the link in the first option.) Download the installation program and run it.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If you don't understand the difference between the two, go for the first option: the
      Java Runtime Environment. You don't need the JDK to build the Firebird docs.</para>

      <para>The current build of the documentation does not work with Java 9 or higher, and it
      requires an Oracle Java, Java from other vendors does not work, especially for the PDF
      build.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-get-tools">
      <title>Where to get the tools</title>

      <para>The tools and libraries needed to build the HTML and PDF documents come as Java
      <filename class="libraryfile">JAR</filename>s and <filename>ZIP</filename> archives. We keep
      these binaries out of git and place them on the Firebird website for you to download.</para>

      <para>After checking out the firebird-documentation repository, look in the <filename
      class="directory">firebird-documentation/lib</filename> directory. It contains a file
      <filename>_readme_libs.txt</filename> with exact instructions on downloading and installing
      the missing libraries. Likewise, <filename>_readme_tools.txt</filename> in <filename
      class="directory">firebird-documentation/tools</filename> tells you where to download some
      required tools.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-setup-build-env">
      <title>How to set up the environment for the build</title>

      <para>The build scripts need an environment variable <envar>JAVA_HOME</envar> pointing to the
      Java install directory.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>On Windows, this is typically something of the form <filename>C:\Program
          Files\Java\jre1.6.0_39</filename>. To be sure, check if there's a directory called
          <filename>bin</filename> underneath it, and if this <filename>bin</filename> subdir
          contains the file <filename>java.exe</filename></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>On Linux, it may be <filename>/usr/lib/java/jre</filename> or
          <filename>/usr/java/jsdk</filename>, or... well, it can be a lot of things. The same check
          applies: it should have a subdir <filename>bin</filename> containing an executable file
          <filename>java</filename> (without the <filename>.exe</filename> extension here).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If you're lucky, the <envar>JAVA_HOME</envar> envar is already present and correct. If
      not, you have to set it yourself, e.g. under Windows with <command>set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program
      Files\Java\jre1.6.0_39</command> or under Linux/bash with <command>export
      JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/java/jre</command>. (Note: these paths are just examples; they may or may
      not be the same as yours.)</para>

      <para>Tip: make the <envar>JAVA_HOME</envar> envar permanent so you won't have to set it again
      and again. How to do this depends on your OS. Consult its documentation if necessary.</para>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-building-output-docs">
      <title>Building the HTML and PDF docs</title>

      <para>If you've made it here in one piece, you are finally ready to build the Firebird docs.
      Here's what to do:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you haven't done so already, this is the moment to read the
          <filename>ReadMe</filename> file that lives in the <filename
          class="directory">firebird-documentation</filename> directory. It may contain important
          information not (yet) included in this Howto.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you are in a graphical environment, open a command window.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Unless the <filename>ReadMe</filename> instructs you otherwise, go to the folder
          <filename class="directory">firebird-documentation/src/build</filename> and give the
          command</para>

          <blockquote>
            <para><command>build</command> (in Windows), or</para>

            <para><command>./build.sh</command> (in Linux)</para>
          </blockquote>

          <para>If everything was set up correctly, you now get a number of output lines ending with
          <literal>BUILD SUCCESSFUL</literal>, and mentioning some <firstterm>build
          targets</firstterm> (things you can build).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Now you can build something more substantial, e.g.</para>

          <blockquote>
            <para><command>build html</command> or</para>

            <para><command>build pdf</command> or</para>

            <para><command>build docs</command></para>
          </blockquote>

          <para>Whatever you build will wind up in the directory tree under <filename
          class="directory">firebird-documentation/dist</filename></para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <note>
        <title>Notes</title>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>If you build the PDF target, you will receive tons of error messages. You can
            safely ignore them, as long as one of the last lines reads <literal>BUILD

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Due to limitations in the build software, some PDF files may need manual
            post-processing before they are presentable. For your own use they're OK though, in the
            sense that <quote>everything's in there</quote>. If you do want to fix them up, read the
            topic <link linkend="docbuildhowto-pdfimprove"><citetitle>Improving the
            PDF</citetitle></link> near the end of this guide.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </note>

      <warning>
        <para>If your local copy of the firebird-documentation repository is placed in a path that
        contains spaces or other non-alphanum, non-underscore characters, the PDF build may fail
        because an intermediate file is placed in a newly created path with the same name, except
        that all the <quote>offending</quote> characters are replaced with their URL-encodings:
        space becomes <literal>%20</literal>, etc.</para>

        <para>The monohtml build too (monohtml is the same as html, but as one big web page) will
        wind up in the urlencoded equivalent of the path. But the images that go with the page are
        placed in the original path. All this is caused by a Java class that performs some of the
        build tasks and converts path names to URLs in the process.</para>

        <para>The best way to avoid these problems is to place the firebird-documentation repository
        in a path that contains only unaccented letters, digits and/or underscores. The second best
        way is to make the URL-encoded version of the path a symlink to the real path. Once you have
        set up the symlink, all the future builds will go fine. (This may not work on Windows,
        however.)</para>
      </warning>

      <section id="docbuildhowto-building-non-english">
        <title>Building non-English sets with <parameter>-Dsfx</parameter></title>

        <para>To build documentation sets in non-English languages (in so far as they are available)
        use the <parameter>-Dsfx</parameter> argument and supply the language code, e.g.:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para><command>build pdf -Dsfx=es</command></para>

          <para><command>build html -Dsfx=fr</command></para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>Non-English output will go into subdirectories like <filename
        class="directory">firebird-documentation/dist/pdf/ru</filename>, <filename
        class="directory">firebird-documentation/dist/html/fr</filename>, etc.</para>

        <para>If you don't specify <parameter>-Dsfx</parameter>, the English set will be
        built.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Not all language sets contain the same amount of documentation. This depends on
          docwriters' and translators' activity. Usually, the English set will be the most complete
          and the most up-to-date.</para>
        </warning>
      </section>

      <section id="docbuildhowto-building-subsets">
        <title>Building subsets with <parameter>-Did</parameter></title>

        <para>The examples given so far all produce the entire docset (for one language). Usually,
        this is not what you want. To build a specific document – e.g. a book or an article – use
        the <parameter>-Did</parameter> argument.</para>

        <para>With the <parameter>-Did</parameter> argument, you must supply the ID of the element
        you want to build, for example:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para><command>build pdf -Did=fbutils</command></para>

          <para><command>build pdf -Dsfx=fr -Did=qsg15-fr</command></para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>How do you know the ID? You can find it in the DocBook XML sources. Look for the
        <sgmltag class="attribute">id</sgmltag> attributes on elements such as <sgmltag
        class="element">book</sgmltag>, <sgmltag class="element">article</sgmltag>, and <sgmltag
        class="element">chapter</sgmltag>. To find out more about this subject, consult the

        <para>As you can see from the last example, command-line arguments can be combined.</para>
      </section>

      <section id="docbuildhowto-building-other-basesets">
        <title>Building a different base set with <parameter>-Dbase</parameter></title>

        <para>Since January 2006, the Firebird Release Notes have been integrated with the
        firebird-documentation repository, but they constitute a base set of their own, parallel to
        the default <quote><literal>firebirddocs</literal></quote> set. This has given rise to yet
        another command-line parameter, <parameter>-Dbase</parameter> (pun intended), whose value
        should be <quote><literal>rlsnotes</literal></quote> to build the Release Notes:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para><command>build pdf -Dbase=rlsnotes</command></para>

          <para><command>build pdf -Dbase=rlsnotes -Did=rlsnotes20</command></para>

          <para><command>build pdf -Dbase=rlsnotes -Dsfx=fr</command></para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>Meanwhile, two other base sets have been added: <literal>papers</literal> and
        <literal>refdocs</literal>.</para>

        <para>The output from alternative base sets is written to the same folders as usual, except
        in one case: the multi-file <systemitem>html</systemitem> target output is placed in
        <filename class="directory">firebird-documentation/dist/html-&lt;base&gt;</filename>, to
        avoid mixing files from different base sets and so that the sets'
        <filename>index.html</filename> files don't overwrite each other. Non-English sets go into
        <filename
        class="directory">firebird-documentation/dist/html-&lt;base&gt;/&lt;sfx&gt;</filename>. For
        instance, the English HTML Release Notes are written to <filename
        class="directory">firebird-documentation/dist/html-rlsnotes</filename>, the French notes to
        <filename class="directory">firebird-documentation/dist/html-rlsnotes/fr</filename>.</para>

        <para>Rendering <systemitem>monohtml</systemitem> and <systemitem>pdf</systemitem> into the
        same folder as the default set causes no problems, as these targets generate single-file
        outputs, each with a unique filename.</para>
      </section>

      <section id="docbuildhowto-building-defaults">
        <title>Setting default values in <filename>build.xml</filename></title>

        <para>Do you often find yourself building the same base set, language version, and/or
        subset? Then you may want to set the corresponding parameter value(s) in the build control
        file <filename>build.xml</filename>, so you don't have to type them on the command line
        every time. Instructions can be found near the top of <filename>build.xml</filename>, at the

        <para>If you make use of this feature, you can still build the other stuff by overriding
        your personal settings at the command line. For instance, if you have set

    <titleabbrev>Keeping the repository up to date</titleabbrev>

    <para>The firebird-documentation repository is a work in progress. Contributors commit changes
    to it on a regular basis. Some time after your initial checkout, your local copy will be out of
    sync with the repository at GitHub. Of course it would be a waste of bandwidth if you had to
    check out the entire repository time and again, only to update those few files that have
    changed. Moreover, doing so would overwrite any changes you may have made yourself. That's why
    git has an <command>pull</command> command. With <command>pull</command>, only the
    <emphasis>changes</emphasis> are downloaded from the server, and your own local changes are
    preserved. (In the event that another contributor has changed a file in the same spot as you, a
    conflict is signaled and you must edit the file in question to solve it.)</para>

    <para>Updating is easy. If you use command line git, go to the <filename
    class="directory">firebird-documentation</filename> directory and type:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><command>git pull</command></para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>This command is the same whether you checked out anonymously or with your GitHub account.
    Git knows which server to contact and how to authenticate you because this information is saved
    in the <filename class="directory">firebird-documentation/.git</filename> subdirectory, which
    was created automatically when you first checked out the repository.</para>

    <para>If you use another git tool, look for its <command>pull</command> command or menu
    option.</para>

    <para>Be aware that git offers multiple ways to update, including fetching and merging
    changes.</para>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-git-update-fork">
      <title>Keeping a fork up-to-date</title>

      <para>If you are working on a fork of the repository, updating requires a little bit more
      preparation. Your local clone of a git repository can be associated with multiple remote
      repositories. By default the repository you cloned from is called the
      <firstterm>origin</firstterm>. You can associate multiple remote repositories (or
      <firstterm>remote</firstterm>) with your clone.</para>

      <para>To add the firebird-documentation repository as a remote with the name
      <filename>upstream</filename> to your repository, you can use:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para><command>git remote add upstream
        https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird-documentation.git</command></para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>The name <filename>upstream</filename> is a common name for pointing to the original
      repository your forked.</para>

      <para>Then to update your fork with the changes from the remote repository, you can
      use:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para><command>git fetch upstream</command></para>

    <para>This part shows you how to deal with these problems, should the need arise.</para>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-pdfimprove-howpdf">
      <title>How the PDF is built</title>

      <para>First you have to understand how the PDF is built. Contrary to the HTML generation, this
      is a two-step process:</para>

      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>The DocBook XML source is converted to a Formatting Objects (FO) file. FO – formally
          called <firstterm>XSL-FO</firstterm> – is also an XML format, but unlike DocBook it's
          presentation-oriented. This step is performed by a so-called <firstterm>XSL
          transformer</firstterm> called <application>Saxon</application>. The output goes into
          <filename
          class="directory">firebird-documentation/inter/<replaceable>filename</replaceable>.fo</filename>.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Another tool, <application>Apache FOP</application> (<firstterm>Formatting Objects
          Processor</firstterm>), then picks up
          <filename><replaceable>filename</replaceable>.fo</filename> and converts it to
          <filename><replaceable>filename</replaceable>.pdf</filename>, which is stored in <filename
          class="directory">firebird-documentation/dist/pdf</filename>.</para>
        </step>
      </procedure>

      <para>If you give a <command>build pdf</command> command, two consecutive build targets are
      called internally: <command>fo</command> and <command>fo2pdf</command>, corresponding to the
      two steps described above. But you can also call them from the command line. For
      instance,</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para><command>build fo -Did=qsg15</command></para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>...transforms the 1.5 Quick Start Guide source to <filename
      class="directory">firebird-documentation/inter/qsq15.fo</filename>. And</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para><command>build fo2pdf -Did=qsg15</command></para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>...produces the PDF from the FO file (which must of course be present for this step to
      succeed).</para>

      <para>In fact, <command>build pdf</command> is just a shortcut for <command>build fo</command>
      followed by <command>build fo2pdf</command>.</para>

      <para>This setup allows us to edit the FO file manually before generating the final PDF. And
      that's exactly what we're going to do to fix some of those nasty problems that can spoil our
      PDFs.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="docbuildhowto-pdfimprove-scheme">
      <title>General repair scheme</title>

      <para>The general procedure for improving the PDF output by editing the FO file is:</para>

      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>Build the PDF once as usual with <command>build pdf
          <replaceable>[arguments]</replaceable></command>.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Start reading the PDF and find the first trouble spot.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Open the FO file in an XML or text editor.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Find the location in the FO file that corresponds to the trouble spot in the PDF
          (we'll show you how later).</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Edit the FO file to fix the problem (we'll show you how later), and save it.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Rebuild the PDF, but this time use <command>build fo2pdf
          <replaceable>[arguments]</replaceable></command>. If you don't, you'll overwrite the
          changes you've just made to the FO file, get the same PDF as first, and have to start all
          over again.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Check if the problem is really solved and if so, find the next trouble spot in the
          PDF.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Repeat steps 4–7 until you've worked your way through the entire PDF.</para>
        </step>
      </procedure>

      <note>
        <title>Notes</title>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Although this FO-editing approach suggests that the problem lies in the FO file,
            this is not the case. The FO file is all right, but <application>Apache
            FOP</application> doesn't support all the nice features in the XSL-FO specification
            (yet). With our manual editing, we force the PDF in a certain direction.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>It is important to fix the problems <emphasis>in document order</emphasis>.
            Editing the FO in one spot may lead to vertical adjustments at the corresponding spot in
            the PDF: more lines, less lines, lines moving to the following page, etc... These
            adjustments may affect everything that comes after it.</para>

            <para>For the same reason, you should always look for the next problem
            <emphasis>after</emphasis> you have fixed the previous one. For instance, don't make a
            list of all widowed headers in the PDF and then start fixing them all in the FO file.
            Fixing a widowed header moves all the text below it downward, possibly creating new
            widowed headers and un-widowing others.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>In general, you can keep the FO file open throughout the process. Just don't
            forget to save your changes before you rebuild the PDF. You must close the PDF before
            every rebuild though: once it's opened in Adobe (even in Adobe
            <emphasis>Reader</emphasis>), other processes can't write to it.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The entire process can be pretty time-consuming, so don't try to fix every tiny
            little imperfection, especially if you're a beginning FO hacker. In general, only the
            widowed headers are <emphasis>really</emphasis> ugly and make the document look very
            unprofessional. Fortunately, they have become very rare since we've moved to FOP

        <para><emphasis>Cause:</emphasis> Apache FOP doesn't support the <sgmltag
        class="attribute">keep-with-next</sgmltag> attribute everywhere.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Since we've upgraded to Apache FOP 0.93, this problem – which used to be our biggest
          annoyance – has become <emphasis role="bold">extremely rare</emphasis>. Yet it may still
          occur under some circumstances. Or, more in general, there may be a page break you find
          awkward, e.g. after a line that announces what's to come and ends with a colon. This
          section helps you solve such cases.</para>

          <para>Note that the example used here – a widowed section header – shouldn't occur
          anymore, but it's still usable to demonstrate the steps you have to take, especially for
          elements with an <sgmltag class="attribute">id</sgmltag> attribute.</para>
        </note>

        <para><emphasis>Solution:</emphasis> Force a page break at the start of the element (often a
        list, list item or table) that the title or header belongs to.</para>

        <para><emphasis>How:</emphasis> If the element has an <sgmltag
        class="attribute">id</sgmltag> attribute (you can see this in the DocBook source), do a
        search on the id in the FO file. For example, suppose that you've just built the
        <citetitle>Firebird 2 Quick Start Guide</citetitle> and you find that the title
        <emphasis>Creating a database using isql</emphasis> is positioned at the bottom of a page.
        In the DocBook XML source you can see that this is the title of a section whose id is
        <sgmltag class="attvalue">qsg2-databases-creating</sgmltag>. If you search on
        <literal>qsg2-databases-creating</literal> from the top of the file, your first hit will
        probably look like this:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;fo:bookmark starting-state="hide"
             internal-destination="<emphasis role="bold">qsg2-databases-creating</emphasis>"&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The <sgmltag class="element">fo:bookmark</sgmltag> elements correspond to the links in
        the navigation frame on the left side of the PDF. So this is not yet the section itself;
        you'll have to look further. Next find:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;fo:block text-align-last="justify" end-indent="24pt"
          last-line-end-indent="-24pt"&gt;&lt;fo:inline
   keep-with-next.within-line="always"&gt;&lt;fo:basic-link
   internal-destination="<emphasis role="bold">qsg2-databases-creating</emphasis>"&gt;Creating a database...</programlisting>

        <para>Here, the id is an attribute value in a <sgmltag
        class="element">fo:basic-link</sgmltag>. We're in the Table of Contents now. Still not
        there.</para>

        <para>The third and fourth finds are often a couple of lines below the second; they serve to
        create a link from the page number citation in the ToC. But the fifth is usually the one
        we're looking for (unless there are any more forward links to the section in
        question):</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;fo:block id="<emphasis role="bold">qsg2-databases-creating</emphasis>"&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>That's it! Most mid- and low-level hierarchical elements in DocBook (<sgmltag
        class="element">preface</sgmltag>, <sgmltag class="element">section</sgmltag>, <sgmltag
        class="element">appendix</sgmltag>, <sgmltag class="element">para</sgmltag> etc.) wind up as
        a <sgmltag class="element">fo:block</sgmltag> in the FO file. Now we have to tell Apache FOP
        that it must start this section on a new page. Edit the line like this:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;fo:block id="qsg2-databases-creating" <emphasis role="bold">break-before="page"</emphasis>&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Save the change and rebuild the PDF (remember: use <command>build fo2pdf</command>,
        not <command>build pdf</command>). The section title will now appear at the top of the
        following page, and you can move on to the next problem.</para>

        <section id="docbuildhowto-pdfimprove-widows-noid">
          <title>When there is no DocBook ID</title>

          <para>What if the element has no DocBook id? You'll have to search on (part of) the
          title/header then. This is a bit trickier, because the title may contain a line break in
          the FO file, in which case it won't be found. Or the title element has one or more
          children of its own (e.g. <sgmltag class="element">quote</sgmltag> or <sgmltag
          class="element">emphasis</sgmltag>). This too will keep you from finding it if you search
          on the full title. On the other hand: the more you shrink the search term, the higher the
          probability that you will get a number of unrelated hits. You'll have to use your own
          judgement here; if there is some characteristic text shortly before or after the title you
          can also search on that, and try to locate the title in the lines above and below
          it.</para>

          <para>No matter how, once you've found the title, go upward in the FO file until you find
          the beginning of the section – often identifiable by the auto-generated FO id:</para>

          <para>As you see, there may be quite a number of lines between the section start and the
          title text. Notice, by the way, how the title is split over two lines here.</para>

          <para>Once you've found the <sgmltag class="element">fo:block</sgmltag> that corresponds
          to the section start, give it a <sgmltag class="attribute">break-before="page"</sgmltag>
          attribute just like we did before.</para>

          <para>Why look for the section start and not apply the <sgmltag
          class="attribute">break-before</sgmltag> attribute to the <sgmltag
          class="element">fo:block</sgmltag> immediately enclosing the title? Well, doing the latter
          will print the title on the next page all right, but links from the Outline and the ToC
          will point to the previous page, because the <quote>invisible</quote> section start – the
          block tag bearing the ID – lies before the page break.</para>

          <para>As said, the widowed header problem shouldn't occur anymore with sections, but it
          might still happen to some other objects like tables, figures etc. for which the
          stylesheets generate ids if you haven't assigned them yourself. In all those cases you can
          use the approach described above.</para>

          <para>There are also numerous DocBook elements – in fact, the majority – for which the
          stylesheets don't generate ids. Examples are <sgmltag class="element">para</sgmltag>,
          <sgmltag class="element">informaltable</sgmltag>, the various list types, etc. In those
          cases, once you have located the text fragment in the FO file, simply apply the <sgmltag
          class="attribute">break-before</sgmltag> attribute to the nearest enclosing <sgmltag
          class="element">fo:block</sgmltag>.</para>

      <section id="docbuildhowto-pdfimprove-splitrows">
        <title>Split table rows or list items</title>

        <para><emphasis>Problem:</emphasis> Table rows or list items split across page boundaries.
        (DocBook lists are implemented as fo:tables.)</para>

        <para><emphasis>Cause:</emphasis> Nothing in particular – there's no rule that forbids page
        breaks to occur within table rows.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Solution:</emphasis> If you want to keep the row together, insert a hard
        page break at the start of the row.</para>

        <para><emphasis>How:</emphasis> Find the row by searching on text at the beginning of the
        row or at the end of the previous row. The element you're looking for is a <sgmltag
        class="element">fo:table-row</sgmltag>, but don't use that for a search term, because many
        DocBook elements (not only <sgmltag class="starttag">table</sgmltag>s) are implemented using
        <sgmltag class="element">fo:table</sgmltag>s and thus contain <sgmltag
        class="element">fo:table-row</sgmltag>s.</para>

        <para>Once the start of the split row is found, add a <sgmltag
        class="attribute">break-before</sgmltag> attribute like you did with widowed headers:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;fo:table-row <emphasis role="bold">break-before="page"</emphasis>&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Alternatively, you can give the previous row a <sgmltag
        class="attribute">break-after</sgmltag> attribute.</para>
      </section>

      <section id="docbuildhowto-pdfimprove-widespaces">
        <title>Overly wide horizontal spaces</title>

        <para><emphasis>Problem:</emphasis> Very large horizontal justification spaces on lines
        above a long spaceless string. These large strings are often printed in monospaced
        (fixed-width) font:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/bigspace.png" format="PNG"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para><emphasis>Cause:</emphasis> Apache FOP often doesn't hyphenate these strings.
        Therefore, if the string doesn't fit on the line it must be moved to the next line as a
        whole. This leaves the previous line with <quote>too little</quote> text, making large
        justification spaces necessary. Note that in the example above, the large spaces on the top
        line are caused by the string on the line below, not by the one on the line itself.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Solution:</emphasis> You may have good reasons to leave the string unbroken.
        In that case, accept the wide spaces as a consequence. Otherwise, insert a space (or
        hyphen-plus-space) at the point where the string should be broken.</para>

        <para><emphasis>How:</emphasis> First find the string in the FO file by searching on (part
        of) its contents. If it's monospaced in the PDF, you'll almost always find it within a
        <sgmltag class="element">fo:inline</sgmltag> element. Then look at the PDF and estimate how
        much of the as yet unbroken string would fit in the large whitespace on the line above. Back
        in the FO file, insert a space – possibly preceded by a hyphen – in the string at a location
        where it's acceptable to break it. Rebuild the PDF (<command>build fo2pdf</command> !) and
        check the result. If you've broken the string too far to the right, it will still be
        entirely on the next line. Too far to the left and the whitespace may still be too wide to
        your liking. Adjust and rebuild until you're satisfied.</para>

        <para>One surprise you may get during this job is that, once you've broken the string in one
        place, Apache FOP suddenly decides that it's OK to hyphenate the rest of the string. This
        will leave you with a part of the string on the first line that contains your own (now
        erroneous) space but also extends beyond it. You'll now have to delete your space and break
        the string again at the spot chosen by Apache.</para>

          <title>Inserting zero-width spaces</title>

          <para>An alternative approach to the wide-spaces problem is to insert zero-width space
          characters at each and every point where the culprit string may be broken, leaving it to
          Apache FOP to work out which one is best suited. This is guaranteed to work at the first

        <title>Squeezed, truncated or otherwise messed-up page-sized content</title>

        <para><emphasis>Problem:</emphasis> Tables, figures or other formal objects are truncated or
        some parts are printed on top of others.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Cause:</emphasis> Formal objects are given a <sgmltag
        class="attribute">keep-together.within-page="always"</sgmltag> attribute by the stylesheets.
        As of FOP 0.93, this attribute is <emphasis>always</emphasis> enforced, even if the object
        is too large to fit on a page. The result: wrecked content that is crammed together on one
        page.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Solution:</emphasis> There are three alternatives. 1: Use the corresponding
        <emphasis>in</emphasis>formal DocBook element instead. 2: Insert a processing instruction in
        the DocBook source. 3: Remove the attribute from the FO.</para>

        <para><emphasis>How:</emphasis> Two solutions are applied to the DocBook source, the third
        involves editing the FO file:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>If you don't mind leaving the element titleless, use <sgmltag
            class="element">informalequation</sgmltag> / <sgmltag
            class="element">informalexample</sgmltag> / <sgmltag
            class="element">informalfigure</sgmltag> / <sgmltag
            class="element">informaltable</sgmltag> instead of their formal counterparts <sgmltag
            class="element">equation</sgmltag>, <sgmltag class="element">example</sgmltag>, <sgmltag
            class="element">figure</sgmltag> and <sgmltag class="element">table</sgmltag>. These
            elements don't get the <sgmltag class="attribute">keep-together</sgmltag> attribute
            during transformation, so they will be page-broken as necessary.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>If it concerns a table and you want to keep the title, insert a
            <firstterm>processing instruction</firstterm> like this:</para>

            <programlisting>&lt;table frame="all" id="ufb-about-tbl-features"&gt;

  &lt;title&gt;Summary of features&lt;/title&gt;
  ...
  (table content...)
  ...
&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Adding the instruction if you're working in the source text is easy enough. With
            XMLMind, it's a bit laborious:</para>

            <procedure>
              <step>
                <para>Place the cursor somewhere in the title or select the entire title
                element.</para>
              </step>

              <step>
                <para>Choose <emphasis>Edit -&gt; Processing Instruction -&gt; Insert Processing
                Instruction Before</emphasis> from the menu. A green line will appear above the
                title.</para>
              </step>

              <step>
                <para>Type <literal>keep-together='auto'</literal> on that line.</para>
              </step>

              <step>
                <para>With the cursor still on the green line, choose <emphasis>Edit -&gt;
                Processing Instruction -&gt; Change Processing Instruction Target</emphasis> from
                the menu. A dialogue box pops up.</para>
              </step>

              <step>
                <para>In the dialogue box, change <literal>target</literal> to
                <literal>dbfo</literal> and click OK.</para>
              </step>
            </procedure>

            <para>By the way: you can do the opposite with an <sgmltag
            class="element">informaltable</sgmltag> if you absolutely don't want it broken at page
            borders. The procedure is the same, except that you must specify
            <literal>always</literal> instead of <literal>auto</literal>. Be sure that the
            informaltable does fit on one page, though!</para>

            <para>We don't have a similar provision for the other formal objects because we probably
            don't need it. (Things like this require work on our custom stylesheets, so we only
            implement them if we really feel the need.)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Ye olde fo-hacking way... open the FO file, locate the element (tip: give it an
            <sgmltag class="attribute">id</sgmltag> in the DocBook source so it's easy to find) and
            remove the <sgmltag class="attribute">keep-together.within-page="always"</sgmltag>
            attribute. A disadvantage is that this procedure has to be repeated every time the
            source changes and a new PDF is built. The other two solutions are persistent.</para>

            section and five of its subsections, which contained the word

            <para><citetitle>If things go wrong</citetitle> – Fixed link to <citetitle>Building the
            HTML and PDF docs</citetitle>: <literal>buidling</literal> -&gt;
            <literal>building</literal>. In the same sentence, the words <quote>at the end
            of</quote> have been changed to <quote>in</quote>, because the link target is not at the
            end of the section (it's just before the first subsection).</para>

            <para><citetitle>When there is no DocBook ID</citetitle> – Removed ID attribute from
            title element, because it was a) unnecessary, and b) a duplicate of the section ID and
            therefore illegal.</para>
