  <title>Still to come ...</title>

  <para>As this is a work in progress, please excuse the 'sudden' ending to
  this book. As I research and document the remaining commandline utilities, I
  shall add new chapters to this book. Until such time as the book is
  complete, this chapter will give brief details of work I still have to
  complete.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><application>Fb_lock_print</application> is the utility which
      prints out details of the internal database lock page.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><application>Gdef</application> is a metadata utility which was
      removed from Interbase 4.0 and returned in the Open Source version 6.
      <application>Gdef</application> is probably redundant.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><application>Gfix</application> allows attempts to fix corrupted
      databases, starting and stopping of databases, resolving 'in limbo'
      transactions between multiple database, changing the number of page
      buffers and so on.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><application>Gpre</application> is the pre-processor which
      converts source code, which can be written in a number of languages,
      containing various embedded SQL 'pseudo code' into correctly formatted
      calls to the Firebird engine.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><application>Gstat</application> allows the Firebird administrator
      the ability to gather statistics about the general health and
      utilisation of various parts of the database.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><application>Isql</application> is the interactive utility that
      allows ad-hoc queries to be run against a Firebird database. It is
      console based - as are many of the utilities - and is supplied with all
      distributions of Firebird. <application>Isql</application> is usually
      the best place to try out your scripts and commands in the first
      instance.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Qli is the original Query Language Interpreter which was removed
      from Interbase 4.0 but returned in Interbase 6.0 because of the decision
      to Open Source Interbase.</para>
