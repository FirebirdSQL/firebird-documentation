        <para><application>Fbmgr</application> is used to start and stop your Firebird
        Superserver. This is different from starting and stopping a database - as
        explained in the <application>gfix</application> manual - as the running databases
        rely on the Firebird service/daemon. This daemon is the Firebird
        <emphasis>engine</emphasis> - without it, nothing will run under
        Superserver.</para>

        <note>
            <para>If you are using Firebird Classic, this chapter does not apply and it is
            entirely possible that the executables mentioned in this chapter may not even
            exist in your installation directory.</para>
        </note>

        <para>On Windows systems, the engine runs as a service and is slightly different.
        Windows will be discussed separately in this manual for that reason.</para>

        <para>In the remainder of this manual, we will discuss the following:</para>

        <title>Linux Systems.</title>

        <para>On Linux, the Firebird engine is started whenever you carry out an install -
        from an RPM or via a script - and at system boot time. This means that Firebird is
        available whenever your system is running once you have Firebird installed.</para>

        <para>At boot time, the script /<filename>etc/init.d/firebird</filename> is
        executed to start up the Firebird engine on Suse servers, other Linux servers use
        the script <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/firebird</filename> instead. The same script
        is executed just before the server shuts down to stop the Firebird engine. The
        engine runs as the firebird user and not as root.</para>

        <para>The script is installed to the location described above, and a symbolic link
        is created to <filename>/usr/sbin/rcfirebird</filename> and the script can
        therefore be called in both ways, whichever you find easiest, but you must be the
        root user:</para>

        <para><screen>tux&gt; /etc/init.d/firebird status</screen>or</para>

        <screen>tux&gt; rcfirebird status</screen>

        <para>This script can take one of the following parameters:</para>

                <para><userinput>start</userinput></para>

                <para>Starts the Firebird engine. If already running, does nothing. The
                engine is started under the watchful eye of the guardian process
                (<application>fbguard</application>) and is set to automatically restart
                if the engine fails for any reason. The engine runs under the firebird
                user even though you have to be root to run the
                <command>rcfirebird</command> script.</para>

        <para>It might be necessary for you to manually shut down the engine from time to
        time, and to restart it again afterwards. To do this, and assuming that either
        none of the options to <command>rcfirebird</command> are suitable or you do not
        have root privileges, <application>fbmgr</application> is your tool.
        <application>Fbmgr</application> is, by default, available to all users of the
        system to execute - however, in order to start and stop the Firebird engine, root
        or SYSDBA rights are required.</para>

        <caution>
            <para>It is noted that the default shell for the firebird user (at least of
            Suse systems) defaults to <filename>/bin/false</filename> and so, you cannot
            log in as the firebird user. This means that you must use
            <command>rcfirebird</command> to start and stop the engine because if you use
            <application>fbmgr</application> as root, then all databases created by the
            engine will be owned by root.</para>

            <para>In order to allow the firebird user the ability to start and stop the
            database engine, you need to alter the default shell from
            <filename>/bin/false</filename> to something like
            <filename>/bin/bash</filename> <emphasis>and</emphasis> set a password, while
            logged in as root, as follows:</para>

            <screen>tux&gt; usermod --shell /bin/bash firebird
tux&gt; passwd firebird</screen>
        </caution>

        <para><application>Fbmgr</application> is a very short shell script which
        currently - as of version 2.1.3 - exports the <envar>FIREBIRD</envar> environment
        variable and calls <filename><application>fmbgr.bin</application></filename>
        passing all supplied parameters over, so
        <application><filename>fbmgr.bin</filename></application> does all the hard
        work.</para>

        <para>As the two are interchangeable, I shall use the former (and shorter!)
        <application>fbmgr</application> in the remainder of this chapter.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Fbmgr Commands.</title>

            <para>Fbmgr can be run interactively or in batch mode. The commands are
            identical whichever mode you use and the following section describes the
            commands and shows examples of each, running in both modes.</para>

            <para>To enter interactive mode, simply log in as the firebird user and type
            the command <command>fbmgr</command>. If <filename
            class="directory">/opt/firebird/bin</filename> is not on your path, type the
            command <command>bin/fbmgr</command> instead.</para>

            <note>
                <para>When you log in as the firebird user, the home directory
                (<envar>$HOME</envar>) is set to be <filename class="directory"
                role="">/opt/firebird</filename>. The <filename
                class="directory">bin</filename> subdirectory, where all the firebird
                binaries live, is immediately beneath <envar>$HOME. </envar></para>
            </note>

            <section>
                <title>Getting Help.</title>

                <para>To see a list of all the commands - except, for some reason, the
                <userinput>start</userinput> command - run fbmgr and pass the
                <userinput>-help</userinput> command (in batch mode) or type
                <userinput>help</userinput> at the prompt in interactive mode. The
                resulting output is the same regardless, including the grammatical error
                "<emphasis>... also be used as an option switches ...</emphasis>":</para>

                <screen>tux&gt; fbmgr -help

Usage:          fbmgr -command [-option [parameter]]

or              fbmgr&lt;RETURN&gt;
                FBMGR&gt; command [-option [parameter]]

                shut  [-now]            shutdown server
                show                    show host and user
                user &lt;user_name&gt;        set user name
                password &lt;password&gt;     set DBA password
                pidfile &lt;filename&gt;      file to save fbserver's PID
                help                    prints help text
                quit                    quit prompt mode

Command switches 'user' and 'password' can also be used
as an option switches for commands like start or shut.
For example, to shutdown server you can:

fbmgr -shut -password &lt;password&gt;

or

fbmgr&lt;RETURN&gt;
FBMGR&gt; shut -password &lt;password&gt;

or

fbmgr&lt;RETURN&gt;
FBMGR&gt; password &lt;password&gt;
FBMGR&gt; shut

            <section>
                <title>Starting Up.</title>

                <para>When the Firebird engine is started, it normally runs under the
                watchful eyes of the guardian process. The guardian will restart the
                engine any time it determines that the engine has crashed and in doing so,
                will hopefully reduce the downtime that the users may suffer as a result
                of a crashed engine.</para>

                <para>It is possible, however, to force the engine to be started up and
                the guardian will allow it to stay down if it detects a crash.
                <application>Fbmgr</application> allows the DBA or System Administrator to
                decide which of the two startup methods will be used.</para>

                <section>
                    <title>Start And Stay Running.</title>

                    <para>At system boot time, the engine is started in the mode that
                    allows the guardian to restart it in the event of a crash. To perform
                    this task manually using <application>fbmgr</application> you would
                    carry out one of the following:</para>

                    <screen>tux&gt; fbmgr -start -forever
server has been successfully started
</screen>

                    <para>Or, in interactive mode:</para>

                    <screen>tux&gt; fbmgr
FBMGR&gt; start -forever
server has been successfully started
</screen>

                    <para>If you are logged in as a <emphasis>privileged user</emphasis>
                    then you don't need to specify a <userinput>-user</userinput> as these
                    login accounts default to SYSDBA when <application>fbmgr</application>
                    is run. If you log in as any other user, even supplying a user name
                    will not be enough to allow you to restart a closed database
                    engine.</para>

                    <note>
                        <para>A privileged user is one that the Firebird engine considers
                        to be privileged enough to automatically be given SYSDBA rights.
                        This means that it can start and stop the engine without being
                        required to authenticate as SYSDBA. At present there are four
                        login names that are assumed to be privileged, these are:</para>

                <para>It appears that the <userinput>show</userinput> command always
                displays the hostname as localhost while you are logged onto that server.
                It is unfortunate that the <userinput>show</userinput> command doesn't
                show any details about the running (or otherwise) Firebird engine. You can
                find this out as follows:</para>

                <screen>tux&gt; ps -ef|grep -i fire[b]ird
firebird  3752     1  0 14:13 ?        00:00:00 /opt/firebird/bin/fbguard -o
firebird  3753  3752  0 14:13 ?        00:00:00 /opt/firebird/bin/fbserver
</screen>

                <para>Look closely at the process details for the guardian, you can see a
                <userinput>-o</userinput> parameter. This indicates that the engine is
                running and is in <userinput>-once</userinput> mode. If it crashes at any
                time, it will not be restarted by the guardian. In
                <userinput>-forever</userinput> mode, the parameter is
                <userinput>-f</userinput>.</para>

                <para>If you don't see either the guardian or the server processes, then
                you can assume that the (Superserver) engine is not running.</para>

                <tip>
                    <para>When using <command>grep</command> to filter out the interesting
                    processes from a call to <command>ps -ef</command>, for example, using
                    a character class for one single character prevents the
                    <command>grep</command> process itself from being listed. The
                    following two grep commands produce identical results but using the
                    character class in the first saves having to call <command>grep -v
                    grep</command> to filter out the unwanted <command>grep</command>
                    process.</para>

        <title>Windows Systems.</title>

        <para>On Windows 2000/2003, Vista and NT systems as well as the non-home versions
        of XP, the Firebird engine runs as a service as does the Firebird Guardian. Both
        of these run under the local system user account. For best results and stability,
        you are advised to keep Firebird running as a service rather than as an
        application.</para>

        <para>After installation, these two services are defined to be started and stopped
        automatically on server boot and shutdown. If you wish to control when the
        services are started and stopped, use <application>Control Panel</application> to
        change their properties to manual.</para>

        <para>On Windows ME, 95, 98 and XP Home, the engine runs as an application as does
        the guardian. In this case, an icon will be seen in the system tray and you can
        carry out manual maintenance by right clicking on the icon.</para>

        <note>
            <para>The remainder of this section assumes that you have the Firebird engine
            and the guardian running as services. All the engine commands are accessed via
            a right-click on the guardian icon in the system tray when running as an
            application.</para>
        </note>

        <para>On Windows, the guardian process is the file
        <filename>fbguard.exe</filename> and the engine itself is the file
        <filename>fbserver.exe</filename>.</para>

        <para>Normally the <command>instsvc</command> command is used to install or remove
        services. It can also be used to start and stop services that already exist. When
        discussing the <command>instsvc</command> command below, it will be used only to
        start and stop services rather than installing and removing them.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Starting The Engine.</title>

            <para>When you start the guardian service on Windows, it will automatically
            bring up the database engine without you needing to physically start it
            too.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Using Net Start.</title>

                <para>Provided you know the exact service name, you can use the
                <command>net</command> commands to start (and stop) the guardian and
                database engine. Up until Firebird 2.0, the service name was simply
                "FirebirdServer". From Version 2.1 onwards, there can be many different
                services running. In this section, only the default services for Firebird
                2.x will be discussed and these are "Firebird Guardian - DefaultInstance"
                and "Firebird Server - DefaultInstance". As there are spaces in the names,
                double quotes are required to prevent errors.</para>

                <screen>C:\&gt;net start "firebird guardian - defaultinstance"
The Firebird Guardian - DefaultInstance service is starting.
The Firebird Guardian - DefaultInstance service was started successfully.</screen>

            <section>
                <title>Using Instsvc.</title>

                <para>As you can see from the above, under Firebird 2.x, the service names
                are a bit unwieldy. It is easier to use <command>instsvc</command> to
                start the services as you do not need to know the default service
                names.</para>

                <screen>C:\&gt;instsvc start
Service "Firebird Guardian - DefaultInstance" successfully started.</screen>

        <section>
            <title>Stopping The Engine.</title>

            <para>When you stop the guardian service on Windows, it will automatically
            bring down the database engine without you being required to stop it
            too.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Using Net Stop.</title>

                <para>As with starting the services, in order to use <command>net
                stop</command> to bring the guardian and engine down, you need to know the
                exact service name (for the guardian) and enclose it in quotes if there
                are spaces in the name.</para>

                <screen>C:\&gt;net stop "firebird guardian - defaultinstance"
The Firebird Guardian - DefaultInstance service is stopping.
The Firebird Guardian - DefaultInstance service was stopped successfully.</screen>

            <section>
                <title>Using Instsvc.</title>

                <para>As with starting the default services, stopping them is far easier
                using <command>instsvc</command>.</para>

                <screen>C:\&gt;instsvc stop
Service "Firebird Guardian - DefaultInstance" successfully stopped.</screen>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Querying The Engine.</title>

            <para>It is possible to query the services running on the server to check
            whether the Firebird services are running or not. Once again, the
            <command>instsvc</command> command is used:</para>

            <screen>C:\&gt;instsvc q

Firebird Guardian - DefaultInstance IS installed.
  Status  : stopped
  Path    : C:\Program Files\Firebird\Firebird_2_0\bin\fbguard.exe -s
  Startup : manual
  Run as  : LocalSystem

Firebird Server - DefaultInstance IS installed.
  Status  : stopped
  Path    : C:\Program Files\Firebird\Firebird_2_0\bin\fbserver.exe -s
  Startup : manual
  Run as  : LocalSystem</screen>

            <para>It can be seen from the above, that there are two services installed on
            this server, but none of them are currently running. Other details are
            displayed such as whether or not these services are started automatically on
            reboot - in the example above, this is not the case - and the user account
            (LocalSystem) under which the services will be run, when they are
            started.</para>

            <para>This command is very useful as it displays the two service names - once
            you have that information, you may use the <command>net stop</command> or
            <command>net start</command> commands to bring the database down and to
            restart it.</para>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section id="fbmgr-caveats">
        <title>Fbmgr Caveats</title>

        <para>The following caveats are all specific to the Linux (and by assumption,
        other Unix systems) and do not apply to Windows versions of Firebird. The reason
        is simple, Windows doesn't have an <application>fbmgr</application> application as
        it uses the <command>instsvc</command> command instead.</para>

        <section>
            <title>The Help Command.</title>

            <para>The <userinput>help</userinput> command, as described above, doesn't
            mention that fact that there is a <userinput>start</userinput> command. There
            is a very brief mention of the <userinput>start</userinput> command, but no
            text explains its use, unlike the other commands which are described.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Who Owns The Databases?</title>

            <para>While not an error as such, this is something that you should be aware
            of. When the server boots, it starts the Firebird engine and runs it as the
            user firebird. By default, the firebird has no interactive shell - it defaults
            to <filename>/bin/false</filename> - and so you cannot log in to, or
            <command>su</command> to, the firebird user to manually run a command.</para>

            <para>This means that, unless you change the firebird user's default shell as
            described above, you will have to carry out any manual restarts etc of the
            engine as the root user - although you can shut it down as any user provided
            you have the SYSDBA password.</para>

            <para>If you do restart the engine as root, then it will now be running as
            root. While existing databases - owned by the firebird user - will happily be
            read from and written to by root, any new databases created will be owned by
            root. Everything will work fine for a while but after the server is next
            rebooted, these new databases will then fail to be accessible as the engine is
            now running as the firebird user again and that user has no permissions to
            access the databases owned by root.</para>

            <para>You are therefore advised to always start and stop the server
            either:</para>

            <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
                <listitem>
                    <para>as root, using the <command>rcfirebird</command> command;
                    or</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    <para>as firebird, using <application>fbmgr</application>.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>but never, ever, as root using <application>fbmgr</application>. If you
            follow the above instructions, all your databases will be owned by the
            firebird user.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>What's That Defunct Guardian Process Doing?</title>

            <para>If you run <application>fbmgr</application> and shut down the database
            engine, the <filename>fbserver</filename> process vanishes from the list of
            processes running under the firebird user. However, a <command>ps -ef|grep -i
            fir[e]bird</command> command will show the following:</para>

            <screen>tux&gt; ps -ef|grep -i fir[e]bird
firebird 29978 29844  0 15:57 pts/0    00:00:00 /opt/firebird/bin/fbmgr.bin
firebird 29979 29978  0 15:57 ?        00:00:00 [fbguard] &lt;defunct&gt;
root     29992 29955  0 15:57 pts/1    00:00:00 grep -i fire
</screen>

            <para>The guardian process, <filename>fbguard</filename>, doesn't vanish until
            you exit from <application>fbmgr</application>. This again is not a major
            problem, but knowing that all you have to do is exit from
            <application>fbmgr</application> to make it vanish is helpful.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>I Can Shut Down But Not Start Up The Engine.</title>

            <para>If you log in to the server as a privileged user and have the SYSDBA's
            password, you can shut down and start up the engine with no problems. If, on
            the other hand, you log in as any other user and try to use
            <application>fbmgr</application> to stop and start the Firebird engine, you
            will find that you can stop it with no problems but you will not be allowed to
            restart it. Only privileged users can start the engine. The following shows
            the problem.</para>

            <para><screen>tux&gt; # Shutdown Firebird engine as user 'norman'.
tux&gt; fbmgr -shut -password secret
no permissions to perform operation

tux&gt; fbmgr -shut -user sysdba -password secret
server shutdown completed


tux&gt; # Try to restart the Firebird engine as user 'norman'.
tux&gt; fbmgr -start
no permissions to perform operation

tux&gt; fbmgr -start -password secret
no permissions to perform operation

tux&gt; fbmgr -start -user sysdba -password secret
no permissions to perform operation


tux&gt; # Give up and restart the engine as 'firebird'.
tux&gt; su - firebird
tux&gt; bin/fbmgr -start 
server has been successfully started
</screen>It can be seen from the above that a normal user armed with the SYSDBA user name
            and password can stop the Firebird engine but is completely unable to restart
            it afterwards.</para>

            <para>The reason why this is the case is quite simple. Until the firebird
            engine is started, there is no way to check that the password supplied for the
            SYSDBA user is actually correct. Because of this, logging in as a privileged
            user assumes SYSDBA privileges and allows you to start the engine.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Shut with no parameters appears to be a bug.</title>

            <para>Running fbmgr's -shut command with no user or password gives the
            following cryptic output:</para>

            <screen>tux&gt; fbmgr -shut
Invalid clumplet buffer structure: buffer end before end of clumplet -
