    <title>About this guide</title>

    <para>The <citetitle>Firebird Quick Start Guide</citetitle> is an introduction for the complete
    newcomer to a few essentials for getting off to a quick start with a Firebird binary kit. The
    guide first saw the light as Chapter 1 of the <citetitle>Using Firebird</citetitle> manual, sold
    on CD by <ulink url="http://www.ibphoenix.com">IBPhoenix</ulink>. Later it was published
    separately on the Internet. In June 2004, IBPhoenix donated it to the Firebird Project. Since
    then it is maintained, and regularly updated, by members of the Firebird documentation
    project.</para>

    <important>
      <para>Before you read on, verify that your Firebird version matches this guide. This guide
      covers versions 1.5–1.5.6. For all other Firebird versions, get the corresponding Quick Start
      Guide at <ulink

    <para>Firebird comes in two flavors, called <firstterm>architectures</firstterm>: Classic Server
    and Superserver. Which one should you install? That depends on your situation. A short overview
    of the most important differences follows.</para>

    <para>As you can see, neither of the architectures is better in all respects. This is hardly
    surprising: we wouldn't maintain two architectures if one of them was an all-fronts
    loser.</para>

    <para>If you're still not sure what to choose (maybe you find all this tech talk a little
    overwhelming), use this rule of thumb:</para>

    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para>On Windows, choose Superserver.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>On Linux, just pick one or the other. In most circumstances, chances are that you
        won't notice a performance difference.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Note that you can always switch to the other architecture later; your applications and
    databases will keep functioning (except if your apps call unsupported or malfunctioning Services
    Manager functions in Classic).</para>

    <para>For Linux, Superserver download packages start with <literal>FirebirdSS</literal>, Classic
    packages with <literal>FirebirdCS</literal>. For Windows, there is a combined installation
    package; you choose the architecture during the installation process.</para>

    <note>
      <para>We've not been completely honest with you. Firebird has a third flavor:
      <firstterm>Embedded Server</firstterm>, but this is an entirely different beast and not
      intended for your typical client-server setups. Consult the Release Notes for details.</para>

    <para>In the major codebase revision starting at v.1.5, the old hard links to InterBase

    permits a running InterBase® server to be present, provided the two servers don't listen on the
    same TCP/IP port. If you need this feature, read <citetitle>Configuring the port

        <para>Although it is possible to install Firebird by a filesystem copying method – such as
        <quote>untarring</quote> a snapshot build file or decompressing a structured WinZip
        <filename class="extension">.zip</filename> file – it is strongly recommended that you use
        the distributed release kit the first time you install Firebird. The Windows executable
        installation script, the Linux <application>rpm</application> (<application><citetitle>RPM
        Package Manager</citetitle>, originally <citetitle>RedHat Package
        Manager</citetitle></application>) program and the official <filename
        class="extension">.tar.gz</filename> for other Posix platforms perform some essential setup
        tasks. Provided you follow the instructions correctly, there should be nothing for you to do
        upon completion but log in and go!</para>

        <section>
          <title>Windows platforms</title>

          <para>The Firebird installer lets you choose between Superserver and Classic Server
          installation. As said before, you should choose Superserver unless you know the
          differences and have reasons to prefer Classic.</para>

          <para>If you install Firebird under Windows 95/98/ME, <emphasis
          role="bold">un</emphasis>check the option to install the Control Panel applet. It doesn't
          work on these platforms. We'll give you a link to a usable applet later on in this
          guide.</para>

          <para>On server platforms – Windows NT, 2000 and XP – the Firebird service will be running
          when the installation completes. Next time you boot up your server machine, it will be
          started automatically.</para>

          <para><indexterm>
              <primary>Guardian</primary>
            </indexterm>The non-server Windows platforms – Windows 95, 98 and ME – do not support
          services. The installation will start Firebird server as an application, protected by
          another application known as the Guardian. If the server application should terminate
          abnormally for some reason, the Guardian will attempt to restart it.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Posix platforms</title>

          <para>In all cases, read the release notes that pertain to the version of Firebird that
          you are going to install. There may be significant variations from release to release of
          any Posix operating system, especially the open source ones. Where possible, the build
          engineers for each Firebird version have attempted to document any known issues.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>If you do not find a copy of the release notes in your kit, go back to the <ulink
            url="http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=files">Downloads page</ulink> of the
            Firebird website at <ulink
            url="http://www.firebirdsql.org">http://www.firebirdsql.org</ulink> and download a copy
            from there.</para>
          </tip>

          <para>If you have a Linux distribution that supports <application>rpm</application>
          installs, consult the appropriate platform documentation for instructions about using
          <application>RPM Package Manager</application>. In most distributions you will have the
          choice of performing the install from a command shell or through a GUI interface.</para>

      <para>If everything works as designed, the Firebird server process will be running on your

        <para>Usually, the first thing you will want to do once installation is complete is ping the
        server. This just gives you a reality check to ensure that your client machine is able to
        see the host machine in your network. For example, if your server's IP address in the domain
        that is visible to your client is 192.13.14.1, go to a command shell and type the
        command</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para><command>ping 192.13.14.1</command></para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>substituting this example IP address for the IP address that your server is

        <para>Note that if you are connecting to the server from a local client – that is, a client
        running on the same machine as the server – you can ping the virtual TCP/IP loopback
        server:</para>

      <para>Each remote client machine needs to have the client library – <filename

      <para>Firebird versions from 1.5 onward can install symlinks or copies named after the 1.0
      libs (with the <quote>old</quote> InterBase names), to maintain compatibility with third-party

        <title>Windows</title>

        <para>At present, no compact installation program is available to assist with installing the
        client pieces on a Windows client. If you are in the common situation of running Windows
        clients to a Linux or other Posix Firebird server (or another Windows machine), you need to
        download the full Windows installation kit that corresponds to the version of Firebird
        server you install on your Linux or other server machine.</para>

        <para>Fortunately, once you have the kit, the Windows client-only install is easy to do. Run
        the installation program, just as though you were going to install the server – but select
        the CLIENT ONLY option from the install menu.</para>

        <title>Linux and some other Posix clients</title>

        <para>A small-footprint client install program for Linux clients is not available either.
        Additionally, some Posix flavors – even within the Linux constellation – have somewhat
        idiosyncratic requirements for filesystem locations. For these reasons, not all *x
        distributions for Firebird even contain a client-only install option.</para>

                <para>In <application>isql</application>, every SQL statement must end with a

                you to spread long statements over multiple lines. If you hit <keycap>Enter</keycap>
                after your statement and you've forgotten the semicolon, just type it on the empty

            <para>The quotes around <quote>SYSDBA</quote> and <quote>masterkey</quote> are optional,

        </indexterm>Firebird SQL</title>

      <para>Every database management system has its own idiosyncrasies in the ways it implements
      SQL. Firebird adheres to the SQL standard more rigorously than any other RDBMS except possibly
      its <quote>cousin</quote>, InterBase®. Developers migrating from products that are less
      standards-compliant often wrongly suppose that Firebird is quirky, whereas many of its

            <primary>Integer division</primary>
          </indexterm>Division of an integer by an integer</title>

        <para>Firebird accords with the SQL standard by truncating the result (quotient) of an
        integer/integer calculation to the next lower integer. This can have bizarre results unless
        you are aware of it.</para>

        <para>For example, this calculation is correct in SQL:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para><literal>1 / 3 = 0</literal></para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>If you are upgrading from a RDBMS which resolves integer/integer division to a float
        quotient, you will need to alter any affected expressions to use a float or scaled numeric
        type for either dividend, divisor, or both.</para>

        <para>For example, the calculation above could be modified thus in order to produce a
        non-zero result:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para><literal>1.000 / 3 = 0.333</literal></para>

            </indexterm>String delimiter symbol</title>

          <para>Strings in Firebird are delimited by a pair of single quote (apostrophe) symbols –
          <literal>'I am a string'</literal> – (ASCII code 39, <emphasis>not</emphasis> 96). If you
          used earlier versions of Firebird's relative, InterBase®, you might recall that double and
          single quotes were interchangeable as string delimiters. Double quotes cannot be used as
          string delimiters in Firebird SQL statements.</para>

          <para>If you need to use an apostrophe inside a Firebird string, you can
          <quote>escape</quote> the apostrophe character by preceding it with another
          apostrophe.</para>

          <para>For example, this string will give an error:</para>

          <blockquote>
            <para><literal>'Joe's Emporium'</literal></para>
          </blockquote>

          <para>because the parser encounters the apostrophe and interprets the string as
          <literal>'Joe'</literal> followed by some unknown keywords.</para>

          <para>To make this a legal string, double the apostrophe character:</para>

          <blockquote>
            <para><literal>'Joe''s Emporium'</literal></para>
          </blockquote>

          <para>Notice that this is TWO single quotes, not one double-quote.</para>

            </indexterm>Concatenation of strings</title>

          <para>The concatenation symbol in SQL is two <quote>pipe</quote> symbols (ASCII 124, in a
          pair with no space between). In SQL, the <quote>+</quote> symbol is an arithmetic operator
          and it will cause an error if you attempt to use it for concatenating strings. The
          following expression prefixes a character column value with the characters
          <quote><literal>Reported by: </literal></quote>:</para>

          <blockquote>
            <para><literal>'Reported by: ' || LastName</literal></para>
          </blockquote>

          <para>Take care with concatenations. Be aware that Firebird will raise an error if your
          expression attempts to concatenate two or more char or varchar columns whose potential
          combined lengths would exceed the maximum length limit for a char or a varchar (32
          Kb).</para>

              <primary>Double-quoted identifiers</primary>
            </indexterm>Double-quoted identifiers</title>

          <para>Before the SQL-92 standard, it was not legal to have object names (identifiers) in a
          database that duplicated keywords in the language, were case-sensitive or contained
          spaces. SQL-92 introduced a single new standard to make any of them legal, provided that
          the identifiers were defined within pairs of double-quote symbols (ASCII 34) and were
          always referred to using double-quote delimiters.</para>

          <para>The purpose of this <quote>gift</quote> was to make it easier to migrate metadata
          from non-standard RDBMSs to standards-compliant ones. The down-side is that, if you choose
          to define an identifier in double quotes, its case-sensitivity and the enforced
          double-quoting will remain mandatory.</para>

          <para>Firebird does permit a slight relaxation under a very limited set of conditions. If
          the identifier which was defined in double-quotes:</para>

          <orderedlist spacing="compact">
            <listitem>
              <para>was defined as all upper-case,</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>is not a keyword, and</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>does not contain any spaces,</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>

          <para>...then it can be used in SQL unquoted and case-insensitively. (But as soon as you
          put double-quotes around it, you must match the case again!)</para>

          <warning>
            <para>Don't get too smart with this! For instance, if you have tables
            "<database>TESTTABLE</database>" and "<database>TestTable</database>", both defined
            within double-quotes, and you issue the command:</para>

            <screen>SQL&gt;select * from TestTable;</screen>

            <para>...you will get the records from "<database>TESTTABLE</database>", not
            "<database>TestTable</database>"!</para>
          </warning>

          <para>Unless you have a compelling reason to define quoted identifiers, it is usually
          recommended that you avoid them. Firebird happily accepts a mix of quoted and unquoted
          identifiers – so there is no problem including that keyword which you inherited from a
          legacy database, if you need to.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>Some database admin tools enforce double-quoting of <emphasis>all</emphasis>
            identifiers by default. Try to choose a tool which makes double-quoting optional.</para>

          </indexterm>Expressions involving <constant>NULL</constant></title>

        <para>In SQL, <constant>NULL</constant> is not a value. It is a condition, or
        <emphasis>state</emphasis>, of a data item, in which its value is unknown. Because it is
        unknown, <constant>NULL</constant> cannot behave like a value. When you try to perform
        arithmetic on <constant>NULL</constant>, or involve it with values in other expressions, the
        result of the operation will almost always be <constant>NULL</constant>. It is not zero or
        blank or an <quote>empty string</quote> and it does not behave like any of these
        values.</para>

        <para>So – here are some examples of the types of surprises you will get if you try to
        perform calculations and comparisons with <constant>NULL</constant>:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>1 + 2 + 3 + <constant>NULL</constant> =
            <constant>NULL</constant></literal></para>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>not (<constant>NULL</constant>) =
            <constant>NULL</constant></literal></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>'Home ' || 'sweet ' || <constant>NULL</constant> =
            <constant>NULL</constant></literal></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><programlisting>if (a = b) then
  MyVariable = 'Equal';
else
  MyVariable = 'Not equal';</programlisting></para>

            <para>After executing this code, <varname>MyVariable</varname> will be <literal>'Not
            equal'</literal> if both <varname>a</varname> and <varname>b</varname> are
            <constant>NULL</constant>. The reason is that <literal>'a = b'</literal> yields
            <constant>NULL</constant> if at least one of them is <constant>NULL</constant>. If the
            test expression of an <quote><literal>if</literal></quote> statement is
            <constant>NULL</constant>, it behaves like <literal>false</literal>: the
            '<literal>then</literal>' block is skipped, and the '<literal>else</literal>' block
            executed.</para>

            <warning>
              <para>Although the expression may <emphasis>behave</emphasis> like
              <literal>false</literal> in this case, it's still <constant>NULL</constant>. If you
              try to invert it using <function>not()</function>, what you get is another
              <constant>NULL</constant> - not <quote><literal>true</literal></quote>.</para>
            </warning>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><programlisting>if (a &lt;&gt; b) then
  MyVariable = 'Not equal';
else
  MyVariable = 'Equal';</programlisting></para>

            <para>Here, <varname>MyVariable</varname> will be <literal>'Equal'</literal> if
            <varname>a</varname> is <constant>NULL</constant> and <varname>b</varname> isn't, or
            vice versa. The explanation is analogous to that of the previous example.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><programlisting>FirstName || ' ' || LastName</programlisting></para>

            <para>will return <constant>NULL</constant> if either <varname>FirstName</varname> or
            <varname>LastName</varname> is <constant>NULL</constant>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <tip>
          <para>Think of <constant>NULL</constant> as <constant>UNKNOWN</constant> and all these
          strange results suddenly start to make sense! If the value of <varname>Number</varname> is
          unknown, the outcome of '<literal>1 + 2 + 3 + Number</literal>' is also unknown (and
          therefore <constant>NULL</constant>). If the content of <varname>MyString</varname> is
          unknown, then so is '<literal>MyString || YourString</literal>' (even if
          <varname>YourString</varname> is non-<constant>NULL</constant>). Etcetera.</para>

      <para>The following is a list of things <emphasis>not</emphasis> to do if you want to keep

          </indexterm>Modifying metadata tables yourself</title>

        <para>Firebird stores and maintains all of the metadata for its own and your user-defined
        objects in – a Firebird database! More precisely, it stores them in relations (tables) right
        in the database itself. The identifiers for the system tables, their columns and several
        other types of system objects begin with the characters <literal>RDB$</literal>.</para>

        <para>Because these are ordinary database objects, they can be queried and manipulated just
        like your user-defined objects. However, just because you can does not say you should. The
        Firebird engine implements a high-level subset of SQL (DDL) for the purpose of defining and
        operating on metadata objects, typically through <database>CREATE</database>,
        <database>ALTER</database> and <database>DROP</database> statements.</para>

        <para>It cannot be recommended too strongly that you use DDL – not direct SQL operations on
        the system tables – whenever you need to alter or remove metadata. Defer the <quote>hot
        fix</quote> stuff until your skills in SQL and your knowledge of the Firebird engine become
        very advanced. A wrecked database is neither pretty to behold nor cheap to repair.</para>

          </indexterm>Disabling forced writes on Windows</title>

        <para>Firebird is installed with forced writes (synchronous writes) enabled by default.
        Changed and new data are written to disk immediately upon posting.</para>

        <para>It is possible to configure a database to use asynchronous data writes – whereby
        modified or new data are held in the memory cache for periodic flushing to disk by the
        operating system's I/O subsystem. The common term for this configuration is
        <firstterm>forced writes off</firstterm> (or <firstterm>disabled</firstterm>). It is
        sometimes resorted to in order to improve performance during large batch operations.</para>

        <para>The big warning here is: do <emphasis>not</emphasis> disable forced writes on a
        Windows server. It has been observed that the Windows server platforms do not flush the
        write cache until the Firebird service is shut down. Apart from power interruptions, there
        is just too much that can go wrong on a Windows server. If it should hang, the I/O system
        goes out of reach and your users' work will be lost in the process of rebooting.</para>

          unless you have a very robust fall-back power system.</para>

        <para>One of the restore options in the <application>gbak</application> utility

        existing database. It is possible for this style of restore to proceed without warning while
        users are logged in to the database. Database corruption is almost certain to be the
        result.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Be aware that you will need to design your Admin tools and procedures to prevent any

        </note>

        <para>If is practicable to do so, it is recommended to restore to spare disk space using the
        <literal>gbak -c[reate]</literal> option and test the restored database using

    <para>The community of willing helpers around Firebird goes a long way back, to many years
    before the source code for its ancestor, InterBase® 6, was made open source. Collectively, the
    Firebird community does have all the answers! It even includes some people who have been
    involved with it since it was a design on a drawing board in a bathroom in Boston.</para>

      </indexterm>The Firebird Project</title>

    <para>The developers, designers and testers who gave you Firebird and several of the drivers are
    members of the Firebird open source project at SourceForge, that amazing virtual community that
    is home to thousands of open source software teams. The Firebird project's address there is
    <ulink
    url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebird">http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebird</ulink>.
    At that site are the source code tree, the bug tracker and a number of technical files which can
    be downloaded for various purposes related to the development and testing of the
    codebases.</para>

    <para>The Firebird Project developers and testers use an email list forum –
    firebird-devel@lists.sourceforge.net – as their <quote>virtual laboratory</quote> for
    communicating with one another about their work on enhancements, bug-fixing and producing new
    versions of Firebird.</para>

    <para>Anyone who is interested in watching progress can join this forum. However, user support
    questions are a distraction which they do not welcome. Please do not try to post your user
    support questions there! These belong in firebird-support@yahoogroups.com.</para>
