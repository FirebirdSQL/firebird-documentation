    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para><firstterm>Nbackup</firstterm> is a backup utility included in the Firebird download
    packages since version 2.0. It offers possibilities not present in <firstterm>gbak</firstterm> –
    Firebird's pre-existing backup tool – but doesn't replace the latter. Both programmes have their
    strengths and weaknesses; they will likely coexist for some time to come.</para>

    <title>Nbackup features – an overview</title>
    <para>With nbackup, you can perform two different kinds of tasks:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Making and restoring of both full and <firstterm>incremental</firstterm> backups. An
        <firstterm>incremental backup</firstterm> only contains the mutations since some specific
        previous backup.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Locking the main database file so you can subsequently back it up yourself with
        copying or backup tools of your own choice. In this mode, nbackup doesn't back up anything;
        it just creates the conditions under which you can safely make the backup yourself. There's
        a provision for restoring here, too.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Both modes can operate on an active database, without hindering connected users. The
    backup created will always reflect the state of the database <emphasis>at the beginning of the
    operation</emphasis>. Furthermore, only <database>SYSDBA</database> and the database owner (and
    sometimes OS admins) can make a backup, but every user can restore a backup to a new database.
    In these respects nbackup doesn't differ from gbak.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Both modes:</emphasis> high speed (as high as hardware and OS will allow),
          because nbackup doesn't look at the actual data. In backup mode the contents are written
          more or less blindly to the backup file.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Backup/restore mode:</emphasis> time and disk space savings, because you
          don't need to make a full backup every time. This can make a huge difference with
          databases in the gigabyte range.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Nbackup can't make <firstterm>transportable backups</firstterm>, that is: backups

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>At this moment, nbackup should not be used on multi-file databases.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Nbackup itself can only back up local databases. However, in Firebird 2.5 and above
          its backup and restore tasks can also be performed remotely through the Services
          Manager.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Except when the Services Manager is used (in Firebird 2.5+) backing up with nbackup
          requires direct access to the database file. With gbak this is not the case.</para>

      <para>Under heavy-load circumstances in some environments, nbackup 2.0.3 and below may cause
      problems that will lead to deadlocks or even corrupted databases. While these problems aren't
      common, they are serious enough to warrant upgrading to Firebird 2.0.4 or higher if you want
      to use nbackup comfortably. If it concerns large databases under Posix, the use of direct I/O
      may also make a difference. More about this in the section <link

          <procedure>
            <step>
              <para>First of all, the main database file is locked by changing an internal state
              flag. From this moment on, any and all mutations in the database are written to a
              temporary file - the difference file or <firstterm>delta file</firstterm>.</para>
            </step>
            <step>
              <para>Then the actual backup is made. This isn't a straight file copy; restoring must
              be done by nbackup as well.</para>
            </step>
            <step>
              <para>Upon completion of the backup, the contents of the delta file are integrated

          <database>ALTER DATABASE BEGIN BACKUP</database> and <database>ALTER DATABASE END
          BACKUP</database>. Contrary to what the names suggest, these statements do
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> take care of making the actual backup; rather, they create the
          conditions under which the main database file can be safely backed up. And to be clear:
          you don't need to issue these commands yourself; nbackup will do that for you, at the
          right moments.</para>

        <title>Making incremental backups</title>
        <para>To make an incremental (<quote>differential</quote>) backup we specify a backup level
        greater than 0. An incremental backup of level <replaceable>N</replaceable> always contains
        the database mutations since the most recent level <replaceable>N-1</replaceable>
        backup.</para>
        <para>Examples:</para>
        <para>One day after the full backup (level 0), you make one with level 1:</para>
        <blockquote>

          <screen>C:\Data&gt; nbackup -B 1 inventory.fdb inventory_3-Mar-2006.nbk</screen>
        </blockquote>
        <para>This one contains the mutations of the last <emphasis>two</emphasis> days, since the

        <title>Restoring incremental backups</title>
        <para>When restoring incremental backups you must specify the entire chain of backup files,
        from level 0 through the one you wish to restore. The database is always built up from the
        ground, step by step. (It is this stepwise adding until the database is restored that gave
        rise to the term <emphasis>incremental backup</emphasis>.)</para>
        <para>The formal syntax is:</para>
        <blockquote>
          <programlisting>nbackup -R <replaceable>&lt;database&gt;</replaceable> [<replaceable>&lt;backup0&gt;</replaceable> [<replaceable>&lt;backup1&gt;</replaceable> [<replaceable>...</replaceable>] ] ]</programlisting>
        </blockquote>
        <para>So restoring the level-2 backup from the previous example goes as follows:</para>
        <blockquote>
          <screen>C:\Data&gt; nbackup -R inventory.fdb inventory_1-Mar-2006.nbk

          <title>Non-connecting links</title>
          <para>What happens if you accidentally leave out a file, or specify a series of files that
          don't all belong together? You could imagine that you specify
          <filename>inventory_2-Mar-2006.nbk</filename> by mistake instead of
          <filename>inventory_3-Mar-2006.nbk</filename> in the above example. Both are level-1
          backup files, so in both cases we get a nice <quote>0, 1, 2</quote> level series. But our
          level-2 file is incremental to the level-1 backup of 3 March, not to the one of 2
          March.</para>
          <para>Fortunately such a mistake can never lead to an incorrectly restored database. Each
          backup file has its own unique ID. Furthermore, each backup file of level 1 or above
          contains the ID of the backup on which it is based. When restoring, nbackup checks these
          IDs; if somewhere in the chain the links don't connect, the operation is cancelled and you
          get an error message.</para>

      <title>Backing up raw-device databases</title>
      <para>Firebird databases need not be files; they can also be placed on a so-called
      <firstterm>raw device</firstterm>, for instance a disk partition without a file system. The
      question where the <link linkend="nbackup-backups-workings">delta</link> has to be placed in
      such cases was at first overlooked during the development of
      <application>nbackup</application>. On Posix systems, if the database was located at e.g.
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hdb5</filename>, it could happen that the delta was created
      as <filename>/dev/hdb5.delta</filename>. In light of the nature and purpose of the
      <filename>/dev</filename> directory and its often limited available space, this is
      undesirable.</para>
      <para>As of Firebird 2.1, nbackup refuses to operate on raw-device databases unless an
      explicit location for the delta file has been set. The way to do this is discussed in <link

    <section id="nbackup-backups-dbtriggers">
      <title>Suppressing database triggers (Firebird 2.1+)</title>
      <para>Firebird 2.1 introduced the concept of <firstterm>database triggers</firstterm>. Certain
      types of these triggers can fire upon making or breaking a database connection. As part of the
      backup process, nbackup opens a regular connection to the database (in some versions even more
      than once). To prevent database triggers from firing inadvertently, the new
      <parameter>-T</parameter> switch can be used. Notice that the corresponding switches in
      <application>gbak</application> and <application>isql</application> are called
      <parameter>-nodbtriggers</parameter> (we love diversity, here at Firebird).</para>

    <section id="nbackup-backups-directio">
      <title>Direct I/O (Firebird 2.1.4+)</title>
      <para>Originally, nbackup used direct I/O only when making a backup under Windows NT (and
      successors like 2000, 2003 etc.) On all other OS'es, direct I/O was off. This caused problems
      on some Linux systems, so in versions 2.0.6 and 2.1.3 direct I/O was switched on under Linux
      as well. However, this turned out to be problematic for certain other Linux configurations. In
      2.1.4 and 2.5 the original behaviour was restored, but this time as a default that was
      overridable by a newly added parameter: <parameter>-D</parameter>. Its use is as
      follows:</para>
      <blockquote>
        <programlisting>nbackup -B 0 cups.fdb cups.nbk -D on    -- direct I/O on
nbackup -B 0 mugs.fdb mugs.nbk -D off   -- direct I/O off</programlisting>
      </blockquote>
      <para>Just like the option letters themselves, the arguments ON and OFF are
      case-insensitive.</para>
      <para>Direct I/O is only applied when making a backup, not during a restore. Under Windows it
      is realized by setting <constant>FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING</constant>. On other systems,
      <constant>O_DIRECT</constant> and <constant>POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE</constant> are used. The latter
      two are sometimes unavailable; in such cases, they are (or one of them is) silently left out.
      Even if the user specified <parameter>-D</parameter> <parameter>on</parameter> explicitly,
      this doesn't lead to a warning or error message.</para>

          <para>The Services Manager always requires authentication, be it automatic (root under

          <parameter>-user</parameter> and <parameter>-password</parameter>. The environment
          variables <envar>ISC_USER</envar> and <envar>ISC_PASSWORD</envar> are not used.

          <para>Note: When Windows trusted authentication is in effect, the account name of the user
          on the local machine is passed to the Services Manager on the remote machine. If the owner
          of the remote database is a Windows account (e.g. <systemitem
          class="username">FRODO\PAUL</systemitem>) rather than a Firebird account,
          <emphasis>and</emphasis> the Windows account name on the local machine is the same as the
          owner account name on the remote machine, the caller is acknowledged as the database owner
          and allowed to make a backup. This could pose a security risk, because even on local
          networks user <systemitem class="username">PAUL</systemitem> on one machine is not
          necessarily the same person as user <systemitem class="username">PAUL</systemitem> on

        <listitem>
          <para>Restoring (<parameter>-action_nrest</parameter>) also requires authentication, but
          once verified the credentials are not used in any way. Hence, the user need not be the
          database owner, <database>SYSDBA</database> or superuser. In the case of Windows trusted
          authentication, the user need not exist at all on the remote machine (where the database
          is located).</para>
          <para>This weak authentication implies another potential security risk. Suppose a
          sensitive database is nbackupped, and the backups are well protected on the filesystem
          level. An average user can't restore the database with nbackup then, because nbackup runs
          in the user process space. But that same user, if he knows name and location of the
          backup, or can guess them by analogy, might be able to get hold of the database by having
          <application>fbsvcmgr</application> restore it to a public folder. After all, fbsvcmgr
          calls the Firebird server, which may have file-level access to the backup. Of course there
          are solutions to this, but it's important to be aware of the risk.</para>

          <para>The Services Manager can also be used locally; in that case the first argument

          <database>AUTO ADMIN MAPPING</database> has the intended effect; this is still true if you
          prepend <literal>localhost:</literal> or the name of the local machine. Local use of the
          Services Manager can be beneficial if you don't have filesystem access to the database
          and/or backup files, but the Firebird server process does. If you do have sufficient
          rights, then it's more practical to use nbackup itself, with its much shorter

      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>Lock the database with the <parameter>-L</parameter> (lock) switch:</para>
          <blockquote>
            <programlisting>nbackup [-U <replaceable>&lt;user&gt;</replaceable> -P <replaceable>&lt;password&gt;</replaceable>] -L <replaceable>&lt;database&gt;</replaceable></programlisting>
          </blockquote>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>Now copy/backup/zip the database file to your heart's content, with your own choice
          of tools. A simple file copy is also possible.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>Unlock the database with <parameter>-N</parameter> (uNlock):</para>
          <blockquote>
            <programlisting>nbackup [-U <replaceable>&lt;user&gt;</replaceable> -P <replaceable>&lt;password&gt;</replaceable>] -N <replaceable>&lt;database&gt;</replaceable></programlisting>
          </blockquote>
        </step>
      </procedure>
      <para>The last command will also cause any mutations - which have been written to the delta
      file - to be merged into the main file.</para>
      <para>The backup you made contains the data as they were at the moment the database was
      locked, regardless how long the locked state has lasted, and regardless how long you may have
      waited before making the actual backup.</para>

      <para>An copy of a locked database is itself a locked database too, so you can't just copy it
      back and start using it. Should your original database get lost or damaged and the self-made

      like this:</para>

          switch, but with <parameter>-F</parameter> (fixup):</para>

          <para>Here too, you can optionally use an alias instead of a filename, and add

        the other hand performs not only an unlock, but also a fixup (integration of mutations into

      <title>Locking raw-device databases</title>
      <para>As discussed in <link linkend="nbackup-backups-rawdevices"><citetitle>Backing up
      raw-device databases</citetitle></link>, problems can arise if a delta has to be created for a
      database located on a raw device. Therefore, in Firebird 2.1 and up, nbackup refuses to
      operate on raw-device databases unless an explicit location for the delta file has been set
      previously. For the procedure, see <link linkend="nbackup-deltafile"><citetitle>Setting the
      delta file</citetitle></link>, a little further down.</para>
      <para>There's also another problem if you lock and copy a raw device: you don't know the
      actual size of the database! The raw device may be 10 GB, but the database might only take up
      200 MB of that space. To prevent having to copy the entire device just to be on the safe side
      – possibly wasting huge amounts of time and space – Firebird 2.1 has introduced a new
      parameter for nbackup: <parameter>-S</parameter>. This parameter is only valid in combination
      with <parameter>-L</parameter> and when it is present, nbackup writes the database size in
      pages to <systemitem>stdout</systemitem> after locking the database. Because the size is given
      in pages, it has to be multiplied by the database page size in order to get the actual number
      of bytes to be copied. Or, if you use the <filename>dd</filename> copy utility, you could
      specify the page size as <parameter>(i)bs</parameter> and the output of
      <filename>nbackup</filename> <parameter>-L</parameter> <parameter>-S</parameter> as
      <parameter>count</parameter>.</para>

  </section>
  <section id="nbackup-deltafile">
    <title>Setting the delta file</title>
    <para>By default, the delta file lives in the same directory as the database itself. The file
    name is also the same, but with <filename class="extension">.delta</filename> appended. This is
    usually not a problem, but sometimes it is desirable or even necessary to change the location,
    e.g. when the database is stored on a raw device. Nbackup itself has no provision for setting
    the location; this must be done through SQL.</para>
    <para>Make a connection to the database with any client that allows you to enter your own SQL
    statements and give the command:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <programlisting>alter database add difference file '<replaceable>path-and-filename</replaceable>'</programlisting>
    </blockquote>
    <para>The custom delta file specification is persistent in the database; it is stored in the
    system table <database>RDB$FILES</database>. To revert to the default behaviour, issue the
    following statement:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <programlisting>alter database drop difference file</programlisting>
    </blockquote>
    <para>You can also specify a custom delta location while creating a new database:</para>
