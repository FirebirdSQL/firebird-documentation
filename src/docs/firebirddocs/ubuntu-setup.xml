    <title>Setting up Firebird on Ubuntu Linux</title>

    <para>This article describes the process of installing and running
    Firebird on Ubuntu Linux. Like the Debian GNU/Linux distribution it is
    based on, installing software with Ubuntu (or Kubuntu) is very
    straightforward and Firebird is no exception. This guide is based on
    Ubuntu 6.10 <quote>Edgy Eft</quote>.</para>

    <para>The version of Firebird packaged with Ubuntu <quote>Edgy Eft</quote>
    is 1.5.3.4870-10 but is labelled "firebirdsql2". Since its inception,
    Ubuntu has followed a strict six-month release cycle so this may change
    with the <quote>Feisty Fawn</quote> release in April 2007.</para>

    <para>With administrator privileges on the target machine, issue the
    following command:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># apt-get install firebird2-super-server</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Apt's dependency tracking will automatically propose all the
    packages required for a complete installation with the following
    output:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>The following extra packages will be installed:
firebird2-common firebird2-server-common libfbclient1
Recommended packages:
firebird2-server
The following NEW packages will be installed
firebird2-common firebird2-server-common firebird2-super-server
  libfbclient1
Need to get 2342kB of archives.
After unpacking 5976kB of additional disk space will be used.
Do you want to continue [Y/n]?</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Ignore the <quote>firebird2-server</quote> virtual package which
    will just ask you to select either the <quote>Classic</quote> or
    <quote>Super</quote> server.</para>

    <para>The packages will then download and install on the target machine, a
    new user <quote><systemitem class="username">firebird</systemitem></quote>
    will be created to run the server, and the server will be started
    immediately:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>Setting up firebird2-super-server (1.5.3.4870-10) ...
Created default security.fdb
Starting Firebird server: server has been successfully started</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>You will then be asked to enter a new password for the
    <database>SYSDBA</database> user, spelling mistake included:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>Plase enter new password for SYSDBA user:</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>You will then be returned to a shell prompt with the following
    output, that's it!</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>GSEC&gt; GSEC&gt;</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>If you're a seasoned Unix person, but new to Ubuntu, you might be
    wondering where all the Firebird files are residing in the directory
    hierarchy. To see where all the files were installed by Apt, simply
    do:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># dpkg -L firebird2-super-server

    </blockquote>

    <para>As mentioned, a new user <quote><systemitem
    class="username">firebird</systemitem></quote> is created on the target
    machine. With administrator access, set a password for this new
    user:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># passwd firebird
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Now you can switch to the firebird user with the
    <command>su</command> command if required.</para>

    <para>If you try to stop the server from running with the <filename
    class="directory">init.d</filename> command an error message will
    appear.</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># /etc/init.d/firebird2 stop
/etc/init.d/firebird2: 28: source: not found
Stopping Firebird server: Your user name and password are not
defined. Ask your database administrator to set up a Firebird
login.
can not attach to server</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The same will happen if you try and start the server. This needs
    further investigation and discussion with the Debian and Ubuntu Firebird
    packagers to iron out, but for now to stop the server:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># su -c "fbmgr -shut -password <replaceable>SYSDBApassword</replaceable>" firebird
Password:
server shutdown completed</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Where <replaceable>SYSDBApassword</replaceable> is the password you
    entered immediately after installation and the second password is the
    firebird user password. To start the server again:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># su -c "fbmgr -start" firebird</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>With the installation complete, you can now begin using Firebird on
    Ubuntu Linux. The base package does not include any example databases, so
    if you like, install some with:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># apt-get install firebird2-examples</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>These will be installed in <filename
    class="directory">/usr/share/doc/firebird2-examples/</filename>. While
    you're at it, install the utilities package:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># sudo apt-get install firebird2-utils-super</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>This will give you an interactive shell, and backup and reporting
    tools among others. Now you can test your Firebird installation by
    connecting to an example database. Decompress the example
    <quote><filename>employee.fdb</filename></quote> database:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># gunzip
# /usr/share/doc/firebird2-examples/examples/employee.fdb.gz</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Fire up the interactive shell.</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># isql-fb</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>At the SQL&gt; prompt, connect to the database with:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>SQL&gt; connect "employee.fdb" user 'SYSDBA' password '<replaceable>SYSDBApassword</replaceable>';</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>If you get an error message like <quote>Statement failed, SQLCODE =
    -551 no permission for read-write access to database
    /usr/share/doc/firebird2-examples/examples/employee.fdb</quote>, then the
    server process doesn't have read or write access to the database file.
    Change the ownership of the database to the user <systemitem
    class="username">firebird</systemitem> with:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen># chown firebird:firebird employee.fdb</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>When you manage to successfully connect to the database you will see
    the message:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>Database:  "employee.fdb", User: SYSDBA</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Now, from the <prompt>SQL&gt;</prompt> prompt, feel free to browse
    around the employee database:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>SQL&gt; show tables;
COUNTRY                    CUSTOMER
DEPARTMENT                 EMPLOYEE
EMPLOYEE_PROJECT           JOB
PHONE_LIST                 PROJECT
PROJ_DEPT_BUDGET           SALARY_HISTORY
SALES</screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>If you've made it this far your Firebird installation on Ubuntu has
    been a success. Have a nice day!</para>
