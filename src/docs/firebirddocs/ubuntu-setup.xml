    <title>Setting up Firebird on Ubuntu Linux</title>

    <para>This article describes the process of installing and running
    Firebird on Ubuntu Linux. It should also work without modification in the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
    (stable /testing / unstable).
    Ubuntu is based on Debian core packages. Installing software with Ubuntu is very
    straightforward and Firebird is no exception. This guide is based on
    Ubuntu 12.04 LTS <quote>The Precise Pangolin</quote> but it can be used with a current supported stable release.</para>

    <para>The version of Firebird packaged with Ubuntu <quote>Precise Pangolin</quote>
    is 2.5.1 and is included by default . For stable Ubuntu releases there is
    a Firebird stable <ulink url="http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Firebird2.5">ppa repository</ulink> 
    from where you can install the stable versions latest LTS and current stable 
    .</para>


    <para>With administrator privileges on the target machine, issue the
    following command:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>
      $ sudo su
      # apt-get install firebird2.5-superclassic
      </screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Apt's dependency tracking will automatically propose all the
    packages required for a complete installation with the following
    output:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>      
	Reading package lists... Done
	Building dependency tree       
	Reading state information... Done
	The following extra packages will be installed:
  		firebird2.5-classic-common firebird2.5-common firebird2.5-common-doc firebird2.5-server-common libfbclient2 libfbembed2.5 libib-util
	Suggested packages:
  		firebird2.5-doc
	The following NEW packages will be installed:
  		firebird2.5-classic-common firebird2.5-common firebird2.5-common-doc firebird2.5-server-common firebird2.5-superclassic libfbclient2 libfbembed2.5 libib-util

	Need to get 3,370 kB of archives.
	After this operation, 14.9 MB of additional disk space will be used.
	Do you want to continue [Y/n]? Y
      </screen>
    </blockquote>


    <para>The packages will then download and install on the target machine. A
    new user <quote><systemitem class="username">firebird</systemitem></quote>
    will be created to run the server, but the server will not yet be started by default:</para>

    </blockquote>

    <para>If you want Firebird to start automatically, run dpkg-reconfigure on the package and click the Yes button.
     Then you will be asked again for the <database>SYSDBA</database> password:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>
      # dpkg-reconfigure firebird2.5-superclassic

    <para>If all goes well, Firebird Superserver will be started:</para>

 	  * Firebird 2.5 superclassic server already running
          
      </screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>If you're a seasoned Unix person but new to Ubuntu, you might be
    wondering where all the Firebird files are residing in the directory
    hierarchy. To see where all the files were installed by Apt, simply
    do:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>
      # dpkg -L firebird2.5-classic-common
      /.

/usr/share
/usr/share/doc

    </blockquote>

    <para>As mentioned, a new user <quote><systemitem
    class="username">firebird</systemitem></quote> is created on the target
    machine. </para>

    <para>Now you can switch to the <systemitem class="username">firebird</systemitem> user with the
    <command>su</command> command if required.</para>
        <blockquote>
      <screen>
      # su firebird 
      </screen>
    </blockquote>
    

    <para>Install the examples and dev files:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>
      # apt-get install firebird2.5-examples firebird2.5-dev  
      </screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The example databases will wind up in the directory tree 
      <filename class='directory'>/usr/share/doc/firebird2.5-examples/examples/empbuild/</filename>.</para>

     <para>Now you can test your Firebird installation by connecting to an example database.
       Decompress the <filename>employee.fdb</filename> example database:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>
      # cd /usr/share/doc/firebird2.5-examples/examples/empbuild/
	  #	gunzip employee.fdb.gz
	  #	sudo chown firebird.firebird employee.fdb
	  # mv employee.fdb /var/lib/firebird/2.5/data/
      </screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Fire up the interactive shell and at the <prompt>SQL&gt;</prompt> prompt connect to the employee database using the
      <ulink url="http://www.firebirdsql.org/manual/qsg2-databases.html#qsg2-databases-connecting">connect statement</ulink>:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>
      isql-fb
      SQL> connect "localhost:/var/lib/firebird/2.5/data/employee.fdb" user 'SYSDBA'
               password '<replaceable>SYSDBApassword</replaceable>';
      </screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>(replacing <replaceable>SYSDBApassword</replaceable>
      with the correct password for <database>SYSDBA</database>!)</para>

    <para>When you manage to successfully connect to the database you will see
    the message:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <screen>
      Database:  "localhost:/var/lib/firebird/2.5/data/employee.fdb", User: SYSDBA
      SQL>
      </screen>
    </blockquote>
    <para>Now, from the <prompt>SQL&gt;</prompt> prompt, feel free to browse around the employee database.
      For instance, you can list the tables and check the server version:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <screen>
      SQL> show tables;
       COUNTRY                                CUSTOMER

       EMPLOYEE_PROJECT                       JOB
       PROJECT                                PROJ_DEPT_BUDGET
       SALARY_HISTORY                         SALES
      SQL> show version;
      SQL Version: LI-V2.5.2.26508 Firebird 2.5

Firebird/linux AMD64 (remote interface), version "LI-V2.5.2.26508 Firebird 2.5/tcp (Lorkstation64)/P12"
on disk structure version 11.2     
      SQL> quit;
      </screen>
    </blockquote>
    <para>If you want a GUI admin tool, you might check FlameRobin, which is included in the Ubuntu repository.
      It can be installed with a simple:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <screen>
      # apt-get install flamerobin
      </screen>
    </blockquote>



    <para>If you get an error message like <quote>Statement failed, SQLCODE =
    -551 no permission for read-write access to database
    /var/lib/firebird/2.5/data/employee.fdb</quote>, then the
    server process doesn't have read or write access to the database file.
    Change the ownership of the database to the user <systemitem
    class="username">firebird</systemitem> with:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <screen>
      # cd /var/lib/firebird/2.5/data/
      # chown firebird:firebird employee.fdb
      </screen>
    </blockquote>
    <para>If you've made it this far, your Firebird installation on Ubuntu has
    been a success. Have a nice day!</para>
