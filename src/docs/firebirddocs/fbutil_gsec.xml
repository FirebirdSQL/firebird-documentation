  <title>GSEC - Firebird Password File Utility</title>

  <section id="fbutils-gsec-intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para><application>GSEC</application> is the security database
    manipulation utility. It allows the DBA (or any privileged user) the
    ability to maintain user accounts for various Firebird databases. Using
    various options, users can be added, amended or deleted from the security
    database.</para>

    <para>Normal users, ie those not endowed with DBA privileges, can only see
    their own user details from version 2.0 of Firebird. They can, however,
    change their own passwords with the new version. Previous to the new
    version, the DBA had to make the changes.</para>

    <note>
      <para>It is possible on some operating systems that users will not be
      able to run <application>GSEC</application>, even if they know the
      sysdba password. This is because those operating systems allow the
      system administrator to set filesystem permissions which prevent
      execution of certain programs and utilities for security reasons.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The Firebird database holds details of all users in a single
    security database. This is located on the server in a normal Firebird
    database named <filename>security.fdb</filename> for Firebird 1.5 or
    <filename>security2.fdb</filename> for Firebird 2.0 onwards. The default
    locations for this file are :</para>

    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para><filename class="directory">C:\Program
        Files\Firebird\Firebird_1_5</filename> for Windows.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><filename class="directory">/opt/firebird</filename> for Linux
        and other Unix systems.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The security database has two tables, <database
    class="table">users</database> and <database
    class="table">host_info</database>. The <database
    class="table">host_info</database> table is empty and the
    <database>users</database> table holds the details of each user allowed to
    access any Firebird database. Having said that, database roles and
    privileges will prevent users logging into and manipulating databases to
    which they have no rights.</para>

    <para>The <application>GSEC</application> utility manipulates data in the
    <database>users</database> table in the security database, and by doing
    so, allows users to be added, amended and deleted from the system. Not all
    columns of the <database>users</database> table are able to be displayed,
    even though they can be amended. The user's <database
    class="field">password</database> column is never shown by
    <application>GSEC</application>, but you can change it, for
    example.</para>

    <para>Like most of the command line utilities supplied with Firebird,
    <application>GSEC</application> can be run in interactive or batch mode
    and has a help screen showing all of the utility's options, we'll be
    seeing that a little later on.</para>

    <title>Commandline Options</title>

    <para>Regardless of the mode that <application>GSEC</application> is run
    in, there are a number of options that can be supplied on the command
    line. These are :</para>

    <itemizedlist spacing="normal">
      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-user &lt;username&gt;</userinput></para>

        <para>Allows the username of the sysdba user to be specified if the
        database is to be modified, or a normal username if the database is to
        be displayed only. This need not be supplied if
        <envar>ISC_USER</envar> and <envar>ISC_PASSWORD</envar> environment
        variables exist and have the correct values.</para>
      </listitem>

        <para>You can specify the full pathname of a security database to
        <application>GSEC</application> and this will allow you to remotely
        administer the users for that server. The whole parameter should be

  <section id="fbutils-gsec-commands">
    <title>GSEC Commands</title>

    <para>After the assorted options, comes the command that you wish to run.
    The following commands are available in both batch and interactive modes,
    but for interactive mode the leading minus sign is not required.</para>

    <itemizedlist spacing="normal">
      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-add &lt;name&gt; [ &lt;parameter&gt; ...
        ]</userinput></para>

        <para>This command adds a new user to the database. You may optionally
        add other details such as first, middle and last names plus a password
        for the new user, all in the same <userinput>add</userinput> command.
        Alternatively, you may add a user then <userinput>modify</userinput>
        it to fill in the missing details.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-delete &lt;name&gt;</userinput></para>

        <para>This command removes the named user from the database. All
        details of the user are removed and cannot be undone unless you add
        the user back again.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-display [ &lt;name&gt; ]</userinput></para>

        <para>This command displays the details of a single named user, or all
        users in the database. The password is never displayed.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-modify &lt;name&gt; &lt;parameter&gt; [
        &lt;parameter&gt; ... ]</userinput></para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The &lt;name&gt; option is how you wish the user to be known when
    connecting to Firebird databases. Some of the above commands take
    parameters and these are one, or more, of the following :</para>

    <itemizedlist spacing="normal">
      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-pw &lt;password&gt;</userinput></para>

        <para>This parameter lets you supply a new password for the user. If
        you omit the password, the current one will be removed and the user
        will be unable to login to any Firebird databases at all. The password
        can be up to 8 characters long, but when supplying one to
        <application>GSEC</application>, or logging into databases, the
        characters after the eighth are simply ignored.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-uid &lt;uid&gt;</userinput></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-gid &lt;gid&gt;</userinput></para>

        <para><userinput>-uid</userinput> and <userinput>-gid</userinput> are
        used on some POSIX systems to enter the Unix userid and groupid as
        found in <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and
        <filename>/etc/group</filename> configuration files. If not supplied,
        these default to zero.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-fname [ &lt;first name&gt; ]</userinput></para>

        <para>This parameter allows you to store the user's first name in the
        database. This helps when identifying users from their login name -
        which may be abbreviated. You can delete a first name by not supplying
        a name.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-mname [ &lt;middle name&gt; ]</userinput></para>

        <para>This parameter allows you to store the user's middle name in the
        database. This helps when identifying users from their login name -
        which may be abbreviated. You can delete a middle name by not
        supplying a name.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><userinput>-lname [ &lt;lastname&gt; ]</userinput></para>

        <para>This parameter allows you to store the user's last name in the
        database. This helps when identifying users from their login name -
        which may be abbreviated. You can delete a last name by not supplying
        a name.</para>

  </section>

  <section id="fbutils-gsec-interactive">
    <title>Interactive Mode</title>

    <para>To run <application>GSEC</application> in interactive mode, start
    the utility using the command line :</para>

    <screen>C:\&gt;gsec -user sysdba -password masterkey
GSEC&gt;</screen>

    <para>The GSEC&gt; prompt shows that the utility is waiting for a command.
    The -user and -password options are those of the user who wishes to
    manipulate the security database. Obviously, the username supplied must be
    a valid sysdba user if updates are to be carried out. Normal users may
    only read the database.</para>

    <para>To exit <application><application>GSEC</application></application>
    in interactive mode, the quit command is used :</para>

    <screen>GSEC&gt; quit

    <warning>
      <para>If you are using <application>GSEC</application> from Firebird
      version 1.5 (and possibly version 1.0 as well) then when you are running

    <section id="fbutils-gsec-batch-version">
      <title>Version Information</title>

      <para>The version of GSEC can be obtained using the
      <userinput>-z</userinput> command. However, note that it leaves you in
      interactive mode on completion. It doesn't exit like the other batch
      mode commands do, so you have to use the interactive
      <userinput>quit</userinput> command to exit. There is a way around this
      problem as shown in the following. The first part shows the
      problem.</para>

      <screen>C:\&gt;gsec -z
gsec version  WI-V1.5.0.4306 Firebird 1.5
GSEC&gt; </screen>

      <para>The solution is to have a small file containing the command
      <userinput>quit</userinput> and force GSEC to read this file when it
      needs user input, as follows.</para>

      <screen>C:\&gt;copy con fred
quit
^Z
        1 file(s) copied.</screen>

      <screen>C:\&gt;gsec -z &lt;fred
gsec version  WI-V1.5.0.4306 Firebird 1.5
GSEC&gt;
C:\&gt;</screen>

      <para>This could be a good idea for any of the commands which leave you
      'stuck' in the interactive mode when you thought you were running in
      batch mode. By redirecting input from a command file, GSEC will read a
      line of text from that file any time it requires user input. By forcing
      it to read the <userinput>quit</userinput> command, you make it
      exit.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The -z command doesn't need a <userinput>-user</userinput> and
        <userinput>-password</userinput>, it will display the version details
        and then tell you that you don't have a username/password - but you
        can safely ignore this message.</para>

  <section id="fbutils-gsec-remote">
    <title id="fbutils-gsec-remote-hotlink">Running GSEC Remotely</title>

    <para><application>GSEC</application> can be used to administer the
    security database on a remote server. To do this you must supply the
    remote security database name on the commandline as shown in the following
    example which connects my Windows XP client version of
    <application>GSEC</application> to my Linux server named Ganymede and
    allows me to manage the users on my Linux server.</para>

    <screen>C:\&gt;gsec -database ganymede:/opt/firebird/security.fdb 
         -user sysdba -password masterkey
GSEC&gt;</screen>

    <note>
      <para>In the above example, I have split the full commandline over two
      lines. This is to prevent it 'falling off' the right side of the page
      when this chapter is rendered as a PDF document. The whole command
      should, and must, be typed on a single line.</para>

      <para>Also note that if there are spaces in the database name, you must
      enclose the whole parameter in double quotes.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Once connected to the remote security database, you can manipulate
    users in the normal manner in either interactive or batch modes as
    described above.</para>

    <para>The version of GSEC provided in Firebird 2.0 can be used to maintain
    the security database on previous versions of Firebird and it is hoped,
    Interbase from version 6.0 upwards. However, under version 2.0 of
    Firebird, the format of the security database will be changed and because
    of this, GSEC from an older version cannot be used to maintain the
    security database for Firebird 2.0.</para>

  <section id="fbutils-gsec-caveats">
    <title>GSEC caveats</title>

    <para>The following is a brief list of gotchas and funnies that I have
    detected in my own use of GSEC. Some of these are mentioned above, others
    may not be. By collecting them all here in one place, you should be able
    to find out what's happening if you have problems.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Normal Versus Privileged Users</title>

      <para>Only a sysdba user can update the security database. Normal users
      can run the <application>GSEC</application> utility, but can only list
      the contents under Firebird 1.5. The following shows what happens when
      trying to update the database when running
      <application>GSEC</application> as a normal user.</para>

      <screen>C:\&gt;gsec -user norman -password norman
GSEC&gt; add myuser -pw mypassword
add record error
no permission for insert/write access to TABLE USERS</screen>

      <para>A normal users can only display details from the security
      database.</para>

      <screen>C:\&gt;gsec -user norman -password norman -display

      <note>
        <para>From Firebird version 2 onwards, there are slight changes to the
        above. Users are now able to change their own passwords and can no
        longer display details of other users that may be present in the
        security database.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The above user, running under Firebird 2.0 would see the following

      <title>Differences Between Batch And Interactive Mode</title>

      <para>The <application>GSEC</application> commands apply to both modes
      of operation, however, when running in batch mode, you must prefix the
      command name with a minus sign (-) or you will get an error message
      similar to the following :</para>

      <screen>C:\&gt;gsec -user sysdba -password masterkey display
invalid parameter, no switch defined
error in switch specifications
GSEC&gt;</screen>

      <para>Note also that you will be left in interactive mode when an error
      occurs. The correct commandline should have a minus in front of the
      <userinput>display</userinput> command, as follows :</para>

      <screen>C:\&gt;gsec -user sysdba -password masterkey -display
     user name                      uid   gid     full name

      <para>This time, <application>GSEC</application> performed its duties,
      displayed all known users and quit from the utility.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>If environment variables <envar>ISC_USER</envar> and
        <envar>ISC_PASSWORD</envar> have been defined, and this isn't a very
        good idea for security reasons, <application>GSEC</application> can be
        run without passing the <userinput>-user</userinput> or
        <userinput>-password</userinput> options.</para>
      </warning>

      <warning>
        <para>As with all of the command line utilities, it is best to use the
        version of he <application>GSEC</application> utility that was
        supplied with your database.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Batch Mode Exit Codes</title>

      <para>When running <application>GSEC</application> under windows, you
      can trap the exit code in <envar>%ERRORLEVEL%</envar> and check it to
      determine the success or failure of the last command executed.</para>

      <para>When your operating system is Unix - whatever flavour - the exit
      code is to be found in the <envar>$?</envar> variable.</para>

      <para>Unfortunately, using the version of
      <application>GSEC</application> supplied with Firebird 1.5, it appears
      that <application>GSEC</application> always exits with a zero and this
      makes it quite unsuitable to build into a properly error trapped batch
      script on either system. Sad but true.</para>

      <para>From version 2.0 of Firebird, this has been corrected and an exit
      code of zero indicates success while non-zero values indicate
      failures.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Errors In Batch Mode Swap To Interactive Mode</title>

      <para>Sometimes, when running in batch mode, an error condition in GSEC
      will result in GSEC switching over to interactive mode. This is not very
      useful if you started GSEC in batch mode from a script, because your
      script will just sit there waiting on something to be typed.</para>
