    <title>About this guide</title>
    <para>The <citetitle>Firebird Quick Start Guide</citetitle> is an introduction for the complete
    newcomer to a few essentials for getting off to a quick start with a Firebird binary kit. The
    guide first saw the light as Chapter 1 of the <citetitle>Using Firebird</citetitle> manual, sold
    on CD by <ulink url="http://www.ibphoenix.com">IBPhoenix</ulink>. Later it was published
    separately on the Internet. In June 2004, IBPhoenix donated it to the Firebird Project. Since
    then it is maintained, and regularly updated, by members of the Firebird documentation
    project.</para>
    <important>
      <para>Before you read on, verify that this guide matches your Firebird version. This guide
      covers version 2.5. For all other Firebird versions, get the corresponding Quick Start Guide

      </indexterm>Classic, SuperClassic or Superserver?</title>
    <para>Firebird servers come in two flavours, called <firstterm>architectures</firstterm>:
    Classic Server and Superserver. Since Firebid 2.5, Classic Server can operate in two modes:
    <quote>traditional</quote> Classic and SuperClassic, giving a total of 3 models. Which one
    should you choose? The most important differences are listed below. In the vast majority of
    cases, all three models perform equally well and offer (almost) the same possibilities.</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Processes</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Classic uses a separate process for each connection; SuperClassic and Superserver
          use a single process. Thus, if a Classic server process crashes, the other connections
          remain unaffected. With SuperClassic and Superserver, a crash take down all the
          connections.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Guardian</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Superserver can run under the control of the Firebird Guardian, which automatically
          restarts it in case of a crash. SuperClassic only offers the Guardian option under Linux.
          Classic doesn't offer it at all.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Resources</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Being single-process, SuperClassic and Superserver use system resources more
          efficiently than Classic if the number of simultaneous connections grows. Superserver is
          the most efficient of the three, because it also has a shared cache space.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Local connections</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Classic and SuperClassic offer an <quote>embedded</quote> local connection mode on
          Linux which is very fast, but not as secure as a regular network connection. On Windows, a
          separate <link linkend="qsg25-classic-or-super-embedded">Embedded Server</link> is
          available which is even less secure, but can be very practical if you want to ship
          Firebird with your applications.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Simultaneous connections</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Only Classic and SuperClassic allow simultaneous connections to a database from the
          regular server and one or more embedded servers. Thus, if you use the Windows Embedded
          Server, it may be advantageous to have Classic or SuperClassic as your regular
          server.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Multiprocessing</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>On Windows, Superserver defaults to using only the first processor or core in your
          computer. To make it use all the available CPU power, the
          <parameter>CpuAffinityMask</parameter> parameter in <filename>firebird.conf</filename>
          must be edited. All other servers (including Superserver for Linux) support
          multiprocessing out of the box and ignore <parameter>CpuAffinityMask</parameter>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>As you can see, none of the three models outshines the other two on all fronts. If you're
    not sure which is best for you, SuperClassic may be a good pick on 64-bit systems. Make sure you
    install the 64-bits version, though. On 32-bits systems, SuperClassic will be the first to run
    out of memory under high load. Superserver, with its shared cache space, and Classic, with its
    separate processes, perform better there.</para>
    <para>Notice that you can always switch to another model later; your applications and databases
    will keep functioning like before. The differences are in the servers, not in the
    databases.</para>
    <para>For a more detailed look at the various server models, consult the appendix <link
    linkend="qsg25-appx-architectures">Firebird server architectures</link>.</para>
    <section id="qsg25-classic-or-super-packages">
      <title>Installation packages</title>
      <para>For Linux, Superserver download packages start with <literal>FirebirdSS</literal>,
      Classic/SuperClassic packages with <literal>FirebirdCS</literal>. The default run mode for
      Classic/SuperClassic installations is traditional, multiprocess Classic. To switch to
      SuperClassic, run the script <filename>changeMultiConnectMode.sh</filename> and answer
      <quote><userinput>thread</userinput></quote> at the prompt (for
      multi<emphasis>threaded</emphasis>). The script is located in the <filename
      class="directory">bin</filename> subdirectory of your Firebird installation.</para>
      <para>For Windows, there is a combined installation package; you choose the architecture
      (Superserver or Classic) on one of the first screens. If you choose Classic, you can enable
      SuperClassic mode a couple of screens later.</para>

      <para>On Windows platforms, the <firstterm>Embedded Server</firstterm> comes in a separate
      download package. It contains a client and server combined into one DLL for ease of
      deployment. Whilst very practical, it lacks most of Firebird's usual security features (much
      more so than Linux's embedded local access). For more information on Windows Embedded Server,
      consult the <citetitle>Clients and Servers</citetitle> chapter in <citetitle>Using
      Firebird</citetitle>:</para>

        Of course you may have your own specific considerations. When in doubt, consult the <link

          <para>The Firebird Guardian is a utility that monitors the server process and tries to

          Server on Windows if run as an application. This is due to a known bug, which may be fixed
          later. Currently the Firebird 2.5 installer doesn't give you the option to include the
          Guardian <emphasis>at all</emphasis> with a Classic Server, even if you install it as a
          service.</para>
          <!--The problem is that the 2.0 Guardian looks for fbserver.exe. In 1.5.3 it's already fixed;
needs to be ported to 2.0. Silly workaround: rename the CS binary to fbserver.exe-->
          <para>The Guardian works correctly with Superserver, whether run as an application or as a

          <para>If you run Firebird <emphasis>as a service</emphasis> on Windows 2000 or newer, the
          Guardian is a convenience rather than a necessity, since these operating systems have the

        <para>The <command>ping</command> command â€“ available on most systems â€“ is a quick and easy
        way to see if you can connect to a server machine via the network. For example, if your
        server's IP address in the domain that is visible to your client is <systemitem
        class="ipaddress">192.13.14.1</systemitem>, go to a command shell on the client machine and

          <para><command>ping 192.13.14.1</command></para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>substituting this example IP address with the IP address that your server is
        broadcasting. If you are on a managed network and you don't know the server's IP address,
        ask your system administrator. Of course you can also ping the server by its name, if you
        know it:</para>
        <blockquote>
          <para><command>ping vercingetorix</command></para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>If you are connecting to the server from a local client â€“ that is, a client running on
        the same machine as the server â€“ you can ping the virtual TCP/IP loopback server:</para>
        <blockquote>
          <para><command>ping localhost</command> â€“orâ€“ <command>ping 127.0.0.1</command></para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>If you have a simple network of two machines linked by a crossover cable, you can set
        up your server with any IP address you like except 127.0.0.1 (which is reserved for a local
        loopback server) and, of course, the IP address which you are using for your client machine.

          <para>If Firebird is up and running as an application, it is represented by an icon in the
          system tray:</para>

            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          <para>A flashing icon indicates that the server is in the process of starting up (or at
          least trying to do so). A red icon, or an icon with an overlying red stop sign, indicates
          that startup has failed.</para>
          <para>One way to make 100% sure if the server is running or not is to press Ctrl-Alt-Del
          and look for the <systemitem class="process">fbserver</systemitem> or <systemitem
          class="process">fb_inet_server</systemitem> process (and possibly <systemitem
          class="process">fbguard</systemitem>) in the task list.</para>
          <para>On some occasions, you may need to start the Guardian or server once explicitly via
          the Start menu even if you opted for <quote>Start Firebird now</quote> at the end of the
          installation process. Sometimes a reboot is necessary.</para>
          <para>If you're desperately trying to start Firebird and nothing seems to work, ask
          yourself if you've installed Firebird 2.5 (Super)Classic server with the Guardian option
          enabled (the installation program doesn't offer this possibility anymore, but there are
          other ways). As said before, the combination (Super)Classic + Guardian currently doesn't
          work if Firebird runs as an application. Uninstall Firebird if necessary and reinstall
          (Super)Classic <emphasis>without</emphasis> Guardian, or Superserver with or without
          Guardian.</para>
          <para>You can shut the server down via the menu that appears if you right-click on the
          tray icon. Notice that this also makes the icon disappear; you can restart Firebird via
          the Start menu.</para>
          <note>
            <para>Windows Classic Server (but not SuperClassic!) launches a new process for every
            connection, so the number of <systemitem class="process">fb_inet_server</systemitem>
            processes will always equal the number of client connections plus one. Shutdown via the
            tray icon menu only terminates the first process (the <firstterm>listener</firstterm>).
            Other processes, if present, will continue to function normally, each terminating when
            the client disconnects from the database. Of course, once the listener has been shut
            down, new connections can't be made.</para>
          </note>
          <para>In the case of Superserver you can also use a Control Panel applet to check and
          alter the Firebird server status. Some available applets will be presented a little later
          in this guide.</para>

        <para>In Firebird 2.5 and up, <database>SYSDBA</database> (and others with administrator
        rights) can appoint co-administrators. In <application>gsec</application> this is done by
        adding the <parameter>-admin</parameter> parameter:</para>
        <blockquote>
          <para><command>gsec -user sysdba -pass masterkey -add bigbill -pw bigsekrit -admin
          yes</command></para>
          <para><command>gsec -user sysdba -pass masterkey -mo littlejohn -admin
          yes</command></para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>The first command creates user <systemitem class="username">bigbill</systemitem> as a
        Firebird administrator, who can add, alter and drop users. The second command grants
        administrator privileges to the existing user <systemitem
        class="username">littlejohn</systemitem>.</para>
        <para>The SQL equivalents of these commands are:</para>
        <blockquote>
          <programlisting>create user bigbill password 'bigsekrit' grant admin role
alter user littlejohn grant admin role</programlisting>
        </blockquote>
        <para>To revoke administrator privileges with <application>gsec</application>, use

              the <database>RDB$ADMIN</database> role when connecting. However, since nobody can
              connect to the security database, this requires a little trickery: the co-admin is
              granted the <database>RDB$ADMIN</database> role in at least one regular database as
              well. This is done in the usual way:</para>
              <blockquote>

              database can pass the role on to others, so again there is no <database>WITH ADMIN
              OPTION</database>. Once the co-admin has obtained the role, he can connect to the
              (regular) database with it and use the SQL user management commands. It's not the most
              elegant of solutions, but that's how it works.</para>

      <para>Firebird 2.5 offers a number of security options, designed to make unauthorised access
      as difficult as possible. Be warned however that some configurable security features default
      to the old, <quote>insecure</quote> behaviour inherited from InterBase and Firebird 1.0, in
      order not to break existing applications.</para>
      <para>It pays to familiarise yourself with Firebird's security-related configuration
      parameters. You can significantly enhance your system's security if you raise the protection
      level wherever possible. This is not only a matter of setting parameters, by the way: other
      measures involve tuning filesystem access permissions, an intelligent user accounts policy,
      etc.</para>
      <para>Below are some guidelines for protecting your Firebird server and databases.</para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Run Firebird as non-system user</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>On Unix-like systems, Firebird already runs as user <systemitem
            class="username">firebird</systemitem> by default, not as <systemitem
            class="username">root</systemitem>. On Windows server platforms, you can also run the
            Firebird service under a designated user account (e.g. <systemitem
            class="username">Firebird</systemitem>). The default practice â€“ running the service as
            the <systemitem class="username">LocalSystem</systemitem> user â€“ poses a security risk
            if your system is connected to the Internet. Consult <filename>README.instsvc</filename>
            in the <filename class="directory">doc</filename> subdir to learn more about

            <para><database>SYSDBA</database> is a very powerful account, with full (destructive)
            access rights to all your Firebird databases. Its password should be known to a few
            trusted database administrators only. Therefore, you shouldn't use this super-account to
            create and populate regular databases. Instead, generate normal user accounts, and
            provide their account names and passwords to your users as needed. You can do this with
            <application>gsec</application> as shown above, or with any third-party Firebird
            administration tool.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Anybody who has filesystem-level read access to a database file can copy it,
            install it on a system under his or her own control, and extract all data from it â€“
            including possibly sensitive information. Anybody who has filesystem-level write access
            to a database file can corrupt it or totally destroy it.</para>
            <para>As a rule, only the Firebird server process should have access to the database
            files. Users don't need, and should not have, access to the files â€“ not even read-only.
            They query databases via the server, and the server makes sure that users only get the
            allowed type of access (if at all) to any objects within the database.</para>
            <para>An exception to this rule is the Windows Embedded Server, which
            <emphasis>requires</emphasis> that users have proper access rights to the database file

            this worries you (and it probably should), reserve filesystem access to the security
            database (and other databases, while you're at it) to the server process only. Users are
            then obliged to connect via the network layer. Don't remove the <filename

      use.</para>
      <para>Connecting to a Firebird database requires the user to authenticate with a user name and
      a valid password. In order to work with objects inside the database â€“ such as tables, views,
      etc. â€“ you also need explicit permissions on those objects, unless you own them (you own an
      object if you have created it) or if you're connected as <database
      class="name">SYSDBA</database>. In the example database <filename>employee.fdb</filename>,
      sufficient permissions have been granted to <database>PUBLIC</database> (i.e. anybody who
      cares to connect) to enable you to view and modify data to your heart's content.</para>
      <para>For simplicity here, we will look at authenticating as <database
      class="name">SYSDBA</database> using the password <literal>masterkey</literal>. Also, to keep
      the lines in the examples from running off the right edge, we will work with local databases
      and use relative paths. Of course everything you'll learn in these sections can also be
      applied to remote databases, simply by supplying a full TCP/IP connection string.</para>

      <para>Every database management system has its own idiosyncrasies in the ways it implements
      SQL. Firebird adheres to the SQL standard more rigorously than most other RDBMSes. Developers
      migrating from products that are less standards-compliant often wrongly suppose that Firebird
      is quirky, whereas many of its apparent quirks are not quirky at all.</para>

            <primary>Integer division</primary>
          </indexterm>Division of an integer by an integer</title>
        <para>Firebird accords with the SQL standard by truncating the result (quotient) of an
        integer/integer calculation to the next lower integer. This can have bizarre results unless
        you are aware of it.</para>
        <para>For example, this calculation is correct in SQL:</para>
        <blockquote>
          <para><literal>1 / 3 = 0</literal></para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>If you are upgrading from an RDBMS which resolves integer/integer division to a float
        quotient, you will need to alter any affected expressions to use a float or scaled numeric
        type for either dividend, divisor, or both.</para>
        <para>For example, the calculation above could be modified thus in order to produce a
        non-zero result:</para>

          <para>Strings in Firebird are delimited by a pair of single quote (apostrophe) symbols:

          used earlier versions of Firebird's relative, InterBaseÂ®, you might recall that double and
          single quotes were interchangeable as string delimiters. Double quotes cannot be used as
          string delimiters in Firebird SQL statements.</para>

          <blockquote>
            <para><literal>'Joe''s Emporium'</literal></para>

          <para>The concatenation symbol in SQL is two <quote>pipe</quote> symbols (ASCII 124, in a

          <quote><literal>Reported by: </literal></quote>:</para>

          <para>Firebird will raise an error if the result of a string concatenation exceeds the

            </indexterm>Double-quoted identifiers</title>
          <para>Before the SQL-92 standard, it was not legal to have object names (identifiers) in a
          database that duplicated keywords in the language, were case-sensitive or contained
          spaces. SQL-92 introduced a single new standard to make any of them legal, provided that
          the identifiers were defined within pairs of double-quote symbols (ASCII 34) and were
          always referred to using double-quote delimiters.</para>
          <para>The purpose of this <quote>gift</quote> was to make it easier to migrate metadata
          from non-standard RDBMSes to standards-compliant ones. The down-side is that, if you
          choose to define an identifier in double quotes, its case-sensitivity and the enforced
          double-quoting will remain mandatory.</para>
          <para>Firebird does permit a slight relaxation under a very limited set of conditions. If
          the identifier which was defined in double-quotes:</para>
          <orderedlist spacing="compact">
            <listitem>
              <para>was defined as all upper-case,</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>is not a keyword, and</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>does not contain any spaces,</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>
          <para>...then it can be used in SQL unquoted and case-insensitively. (But as soon as you
          put double-quotes around it, you must match the case again!)</para>
          <warning>
            <para>Don't get too smart with this! For instance, if you have tables
            "<database>TESTTABLE</database>" and "<database>TestTable</database>", both defined
            within double-quotes, and you issue the command:</para>
            <blockquote>
              <screen>SQL&gt;select * from TestTable;</screen>
            </blockquote>
            <para>...you will get the records from "<database>TESTTABLE</database>", not
            "<database>TestTable</database>"!</para>
          </warning>
          <para>Unless you have a compelling reason to define quoted identifiers, it is usually
          recommended that you avoid them. Firebird happily accepts a mix of quoted and unquoted
          identifiers â€“ so there is no problem including that keyword which you inherited from a
          legacy database, if you need to.</para>
          <warning>
            <para>Some database admin tools enforce double-quoting of <emphasis>all</emphasis>
            identifiers by default. Try to choose a tool which makes double-quoting optional.</para>

          </indexterm>Expressions involving <constant>NULL</constant></title>
        <para>In SQL, <constant>NULL</constant> is not a value. It is a condition, or
        <emphasis>state</emphasis>, of a data item, in which its value is unknown. Because it is
        unknown, <constant>NULL</constant> cannot behave like a value. When you try to perform
        arithmetic on <constant>NULL</constant>, or involve it with values in other expressions, the
        result of the operation will almost always be <constant>NULL</constant>. It is not zero or
        blank or an <quote>empty string</quote> and it does not behave like any of these
        values.</para>
        <para>Below are some examples of the types of surprises you will get if you try to perform
        calculations and comparisons with <constant>NULL</constant>.</para>
        <para>The following expressions all return <constant>NULL</constant>:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>1 + 2 + 3 + <constant>NULL</constant></literal></para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>not (<constant>NULL</constant>)</literal></para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>'Home ' || 'sweet ' || <constant>NULL</constant></literal></para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>You might have expected 6 from the first expression and <quote><literal>Home sweet
        </literal></quote> from the third, but as we just said, <constant>NULL</constant> is not
        like the number 0 or an empty string â€“ it's far more destructive!</para>
        <para>The following expression:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>FirstName || ' ' || LastName</literal></para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>will return <constant>NULL</constant> if either <varname>FirstName</varname> or
        <varname>LastName</varname> is <constant>NULL</constant>. Otherwise it will nicely
        concatenate the two names with a space in between â€“ even if any one of the variables is an
        empty string.</para>
        <tip>
          <para>Think of <constant>NULL</constant> as <constant>UNKNOWN</constant> and these strange
          results suddenly start to make sense! If the value of <varname>Number</varname> is
          unknown, the outcome of '<literal>1 + 2 + 3 + Number</literal>' is also unknown (and
          therefore <constant>NULL</constant>). If the content of <varname>MyString</varname> is
          unknown, then so is '<literal>MyString || YourString</literal>' (even if
          <varname>YourString</varname> is non-<constant>NULL</constant>). Etcetera.</para>
        </tip>
        <para>Now let's examine some PSQL (Procedural SQL) examples with
        <code>if</code>-constructs:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><programlisting>if (a = b) then
  MyVariable = 'Equal';
else
  MyVariable = 'Not equal';</programlisting></para>
            <para>After executing this code, <varname>MyVariable</varname> will be <literal>'Not
            equal'</literal> if both <varname>a</varname> and <varname>b</varname> are
            <constant>NULL</constant>. The reason is that <literal>'a = b'</literal> yields
            <constant>NULL</constant> if at least one of them is <constant>NULL</constant>. If the
            test expression of an <quote><literal>if</literal></quote> statement is
            <constant>NULL</constant>, it behaves like <literal>false</literal>: the
            '<literal>then</literal>' block is skipped, and the '<literal>else</literal>' block
            executed.</para>
            <warning>
              <para>Although the expression may <emphasis>behave</emphasis> like
              <literal>false</literal> in this case, it's still <constant>NULL</constant>. If you
              try to invert it using <function>not()</function>, what you get is another
              <constant>NULL</constant> â€“ not <quote><literal>true</literal></quote>.</para>
            </warning>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><programlisting>if (a &lt;&gt; b) then
  MyVariable = 'Not equal';
else
  MyVariable = 'Equal';</programlisting></para>
            <para>Here, <varname>MyVariable</varname> will be <literal>'Equal'</literal> if
            <varname>a</varname> is <constant>NULL</constant> and <varname>b</varname> isn't, or
            vice versa. The explanation is analogous to that of the previous example.</para>

          <para>Firebird 2 and above implement a new use of the <database>DISTINCT</database>
          keyword allowing you to perform (in)equality tests that take <constant>NULL</constant>
          into account. The semantics are as follows:</para>
          <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
            <listitem>
              <para>Two expressions are <database>DISTINCT</database> if they have different values

            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>They are <database>NOT DISTINCT</database> if they have the same value or if
              both are <constant>NULL</constant>.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          <para>Notice that if neither operand is <constant>NULL</constant>,
          <database>DISTINCT</database> works exactly like the
          <quote><literal>&lt;&gt;</literal></quote> operator, and <database>NOT DISTINCT</database>
          like the <quote><literal>=</literal></quote> operator.</para>
          <para><database>DISTINCT</database> and <database>NOT DISTINCT</database> always return
          <constant>true</constant> or <constant>false</constant>, never
          <constant>NULL</constant>.</para>
          <para><database>Using DISTINCT, you can rewrite the first PSQL example as
          follows:</database></para>
          <programlisting>if (a is not distinct from b) then

else

else

        <para>Firebird stores and maintains all of the metadata for its own and your user-defined
        objects in special tables, called <firstterm>system tables</firstterm>, right in the
        database itself. The identifiers for these system tables, their columns and several other
        types of system objects begin with the characters <literal>RDB$</literal>.</para>
        <para>Because these are ordinary database objects, they can be queried and manipulated just
        like your user-defined objects. However, just because you can does not mean you should. The
        Firebird engine implements a high-level subset of SQL (DDL) for the purpose of defining and
        operating on metadata objects, typically through <database>CREATE</database>,
        <database>ALTER</database> and <database>DROP</database> statements.</para>
        <para>It cannot be recommended too strongly that you use DDL â€“ not direct SQL operations on
        the system tables â€“ whenever you need to alter or remove metadata. Defer the <quote>hot
        fix</quote> stuff until your skills in SQL and your knowledge of the Firebird engine become
        very advanced. A wrecked database is neither pretty to behold nor cheap to repair.</para>

        <para>Firebird is installed with forced writes (synchronous writes) enabled by default.
        Mutations are written to disk immediately upon posting.</para>
        <para>It is possible to configure a database to use asynchronous data writes â€“ whereby
        modified or new data are held in the memory cache for periodic flushing to disk by the
        operating system's I/O subsystem. The common term for this configuration is
        <firstterm>forced writes off</firstterm> (or <firstterm>disabled</firstterm>). It is
        sometimes resorted to in order to improve performance during large batch operations.</para>

          <title>Disabling forced writes on Windows</title>
          <para>The big warning here is: do <emphasis>not</emphasis> disable forced writes on a
          Windows server. It has been observed that the Windows server platforms do not flush the
          write cache until the Firebird service is shut down. Apart from power interruptions, there
          is just too much that can go wrong on a Windows server. If it should hang, the I/O system
          goes out of reach and your users' work will be lost in the process of rebooting.</para>

          You can force overwriting of the existing database by adding the

        inspection or to make a backup. This is only possible if your regular server is a Classic or
        SuperClassic.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>As you can see, none of the three models is better in all respects. If, after studying the
    above information, you're still not sure which is best for you, 64-bits SuperClassic may be a
    good choiceâ€”unless you need the additional connection-level robustness of traditional Classic,
    where a crashing server doesn't take down the other connections. On 32-bits systems,
    SuperClassic may run out of memory under high load; in this scenario, Superserver and
    (especiallly) Classic Server are preferred.</para>
    <para>As mentioned earlier in this guide, you can always switch models later. De-installing and
    installing another server is usually a matter of minutes, and your applications and databases
    will keep functioning like before. The differences are in the servers only, not in the
    databases. All Firebird databases have the same architecture and can be accessed by any type of
    Firebird server.</para>
