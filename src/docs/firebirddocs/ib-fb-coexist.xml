    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This paper describes how you can make
    <application>InterBase</application> and
    <application>Firebird</application> 1.5 coexist on your Windows computer.
    Please note that the solution provided here will <emphasis
    role="bold">not</emphasis> allow InterBase and Firebird to run at the same
    time. You can toggle between them with a minimum of hassle though.</para>

    <note>
      <para>In order to run InterBase and Firebird 1.5 really simultaneously,
      they have to listen on different ports. This requires some setup on both
      server and client side. Information on how to do this may be added to
      this document later, if the maintainer finds the time. For now, you'll
      have to consult the section <citetitle>Configuring the port service on
      client and server</citetitle> from the Release Notes (in the <filename
      class="directory">doc</filename> subdirectory of your Firebird 1.5
      installation).</para>

      <title>Setting things up</title>

      <para>The procedure listed here must be executed once to set up Firebird
      1.5 and InterBase in such a way that you can use them both:</para>

      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>Install InterBase if it hasn't been already.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Find all instances of <filename
          class="libraryfile">GDS32.DLL</filename> on your local machine and
          make sure to keep <emphasis>only one copy</emphasis> of this file:
          the one that belongs to your current InterBase version. Place it in
          the <filename class="directory">bin</filename> subdir under the
          InterBase installation directory. This will typically be <filename
          class="directory">C:\Program Files\Interbase
          corp\Interbase\bin</filename> or <filename
          class="directory">C:\Program
          Files\Borland\InterBase\bin</filename>.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>If you haven't installed Firebird 1.5 yet:</para>

          <substeps>
            <step>
              <para><emphasis role="bold">Important</emphasis>: If you have a
              Firebird 1.5 Release Candidate: get the final release! If you
              can't or won't do that, <link linkend="ibfbcoex-rc-setup">read
              appendix A now</link> and you'll be linked back here
              later.</para>
            </step>

            <step>
              <para>Install Firebird 1.5 using the installation program (i.e.
              run the downloaded <filename class="extension">.exe</filename>
              file). On the setup screen titled <quote><literal>Select
              Additional Tasks</literal></quote>, make sure the box
              <quote><literal>Generate client library as
              GDS32.DLL</literal></quote> is checked.</para>
            </step>

            <step id="ibfbcoex-step-udf">
              <para>Copy any UDFs your databases need to the <filename
              class="directory">udf</filename> subdir of your Firebird
              installation directory.</para>

          </substeps>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Check your Startup folder (Menu Start -&gt; Programs -&gt;
          Startup) to see if it contains any links to the InterBase or
          Firebird servers and Guardians; if so, remove them.</para>

          <para><emphasis>Windows NT/2000/XP only</emphasis>: If
          <application>InterBase</application> and/or Firebird is installed as
          a service, disable the automatic service startup both for the
          service itself and for the Guardian service. To do this, you can use
          the <application>Windows Services Manager or the InterBase/Firebird
          Manager on the Control Panel</application>. Don't uninstall the
          services themselves, though!</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>If you are using IBX in your applications, and you have
          different versions of the application(s) in different directories,
          then copy the InterBase version of <filename
          class="libraryfile">GDS32.DLL</filename> into your IB application
          directories. If you fail to do this, you will be obliged to specify
          the computer name whenever you connect to IB databases via IBX
          applications. As far as other database access components are
          concerned, we're not sure if there are any issues (let alone how to
          solve them).</para>

      <title>Switching between InterBase and Firebird</title>

      <para>If you have successfully completed the setup steps, you can start
      up InterBase and Firebird at will; just take care they don't run at the
      same time. There are several ways to start and stop the database
      servers:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Easiest, most powerful and therefore recommended: go to <ulink
          url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ibfbcoex/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ibfbcoex/</ulink>
          and get <application>DBServerToggler</application>. This little
          feller, when started, nestles itself in the System Tray and does all
          the dirty work for you. You start and stop either server with the
          click of a button; if you start a server,
          <application>DBServerToggler</application> will first halt the other
          one if it's running. You can choose between application mode and
          service mode for each server independently. Add
          <application>DBServerToggler</application> to your Startup folder
          and you'll have it at your fingertips at all times.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Alternatively you can use the InterBase and Firebird Managers
          on the Control Panel. Just don't forget to stop the running server
          before you start the other one!</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If a server is installed as a <emphasis>service</emphasis>
          (Windows NT/2000/XP only), you can start and stop it from the
          Windows Services Manager, or from the command line as shown below.
          (Note: each box contains <emphasis>one</emphasis> command, to be
          given on a single line, and without any hyphens.)</para>

  <appendix id="ibfbcoex-rc-setup">
    <title>Setting up a Firebird 1.5 Release Candidate</title>

    <titleabbrev>Setting up a Firebird 1.5 RC</titleabbrev>

    <para>Before you read this appendix, ask yourself why you are working with
    an RC. If it's not for any special reason, but just because it
    <quote>happens to be on your system</quote>, do yourself a favor and
    download the final release. Release Candidates are just that: candidates.
    They are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supposed to hang around once the final
    release is out.</para>

    <para>If you know what you are doing and you <emphasis>really</emphasis>
    have a good reason to use an RC instead of the real thing, read on.</para>

    <para>Between Firebird 1.5 RC1 and Firebird 1.5 final, lots of things have
    changed with regard to Registry keys and installation procedures. These
    things affect the way Firebird should be set up to coexist with InterBase;
    they also affect DBServerToggler, which is the preferred tool for IB-Fb
    server switching. However, because development of the Toggler started when
    Firebird 1.5 was in the early RC phase, certain RC characteristics that
    have since disappeared are still supported by it.</para>

    <para>These are the installation steps to follow if you have a 1.5 Release
    Candidate:</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>Install Firebird according to the instructions that came with
        your RC. If there is an installation program and it asks you whether
        it should install a legacy <filename
        class="libraryfile">GDS32.DLL</filename> in the Windows system dir,
        answer Yes. Maybe you have to check a box on one of the setup screens.
        Check the system dir (e.g. <filename
        class="directory">C:\Windows\system32</filename>) afterwards to see if
        <filename class="libraryfile">GDS32.DLL</filename> is present, and if
        it is the one from your Firebird package (look at file dates, version
        info etc.). If it is missing, copy <filename
        class="libraryfile">fbclient.dll</filename> from your Firebird
        <filename class="directory">bin</filename> subdir to the Windows
        system dir <emphasis role="bold">and rename it</emphasis> to <filename
        class="libraryfile">GDS32.DLL</filename>.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>Using the Windows command <command>regedit.exe</command>, look
        in your Registry under
        <systemitem>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\</systemitem> for one of these
        two keys:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para><systemitem>FirebirdSQL\Firebird\CurrentVersion\RootDirectory</systemitem></para>

          <para><systemitem>Firebird&nbsp;Project\Firebird&nbsp;Server\Instances\DefaultInstance</systemitem></para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>One of these keys should exist, and point to your Firebird
        install dir. If this is not the case, go to the Firebird <filename
        class="directory">bin</filename> subdir and execute the following
        command from there:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para><command>instreg install "C:\Program
          Files\Firebird"</command></para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>...but replace the path argument with your own Firebird install
        dir if it's different.</para>

        <para>If the command returns <quote><computeroutput>Firebird has been
        successfully installed in the registry</computeroutput></quote> or
        something similar, good. If not, try just this:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para><command>instreg install</command></para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>(Later RCs choke on the argument; they know what the correct
        install dir is and put it in the Registry themselves.)</para>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>Now jump back to the <link
        linkend="ibfbcoex-step-udf"><citetitle><quote>Copy any
        UDFs...</quote></citetitle> substep</link> in the regular procedure
        (which you've left to visit this appendix) and let's hope everything
        works out. If not, you're pretty much on your own (told you you should
        install the final release, didn't I?).</para>
