<!-- TO TRANSLATORS

Shortly after the v.2.1 Release it was realised that the new fbsvcmgr
utility was omitted from the NewFeatures chapter.  Look for an extra section
in NewFeatures.docbook which is linked to the topic in Utilities21.docbook.

Then (later) it was discovered that the implementation of the MERGE
statement had got lost somewhere in the release cycle!

Much, much later, a regression bug showed up in the implementation of the 
new shutdown modes, affecting everything from v.2.0 onwards.
