Readme for Release notes for Firebird 2.0.1
for translators

There are changes in the following files: 
  rlsnotes20.xml
  GeneralNotes.docbook
  DML.docbook
  Compatibility.docbook
  Optimizations.docbook
  Installation.docbook
  Utilities.docbook
  BugFixes.docbook 
  
  To find the changed passages, the ideal is use the Diff output from CVS.
  However, to assist translators who have partly completed translation of
  the v.2.0 notes, I have tagged the places where you can look out for 
  changes.  
  
  Search the texts for the string "in 2.0.1 -->".
