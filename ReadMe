Firebird manual module
----------------------

After checking out the manual module, and if your Java environment
is set up correctly, open a command window and go to the directory
manual/src/build. Then give one of these commands:

  ./build.sh                [ Unix    ]
  build                     [ Windows ]

to get an overview of compilable targets.

If that worked, try e.g.

  ./build.sh defaulthtml    [ Unix    ]
  build defaulthtml         [ Windows ]

to build the HTML version of the docs.
(Note: the HTML pages will wind up in manual/dist/docs/defaulthtml)

Warning: if you build the pdf target, you will get *tons* of error
messages. Don't let that intimidate you. Just look at the last
output lines: if it says BUILD SUCCESSFUL there, everything's fine.


If you have any problem please post your question to the 
mailing list:
