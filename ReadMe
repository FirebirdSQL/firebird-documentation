Firebird manual module
----------------------

After checking out the manual module, and if your Java environment
is set up correctly, open a command window and go to the directory
manual/src/build. Then give one of these commands:

  ./build.sh         [ Unix    ]
  build              [ Windows ]

to get an overview of compilable targets.

If that worked, try e.g.:

  ./build.sh html    [ Unix    ]
  build html         [ Windows ]

to build the HTML version of the docs.
(Note: the HTML pages will wind up in manual/dist/html)

Warning: if you build the pdf target, you will get lots of error
messages. Don't let that discourage you. Just look at the last
output lines: if it says BUILD SUCCESSFUL there, everything's fine.

If you have any questions, *first* get the Docbuilding Howto at:

  http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=devel&sub=doc

If your question isn't answered there, post a message to the Firebird
docwriters' list. Follow the link on the abovementioned page for
subscription and posting directions.
